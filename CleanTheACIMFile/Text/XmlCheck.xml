                    <string>T-1.I.1. There is no order of difficulty in miracles. 2 One is not "harder" or "bigger" than another. 3</string>
                    <string>They are all the same. 4 All expressions of love are maximal.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.2. Miracles as such do not matter. 2 The only thing that matters is their Source, which is far</string>
                    <string>beyond evaluation.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.3. Miracles occur naturally as expressions of love. 2 The real miracle is the love that inspires</string>
                    <string>them. 3 In this sense everything that comes from love is a miracle.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.4. All miracles mean life, and God is the Giver of life. 2 His Voice will direct you very</string>
                    <string>specifically. 3 You will be told all you need to know.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.5. Miracles are habits, and should be involuntary. 2 They should not be under conscious</string>
                    <string>control. 3 Consciously selected miracles can be misguided.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.6. Miracles are natural. 2 When they do not occur something has gone wrong.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.7. Miracles are everyone's right, but purification is necessary first.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.8. Miracles are healing because they supply a lack; they are performed by those who</string>
                    <string>temporarily have more for those who temporarily have less.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.9. Miracles are a kind of exchange. 2 Like all expressions of love, which are always</string>
                    <string>miraculous in the true sense, the exchange reverses the physical laws. 3 They bring more love both</string>
                    <string>to the giver and the receiver.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.10. The use of miracles as spectacles to induce belief is a misunderstanding of their purpose.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.11. Prayer is the medium of miracles. 2 It is a means of communication of the created with the</string>
                    <string>Creator. 3 Through prayer love is received, and through miracles love is expressed.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.12. Miracles are thoughts. 2 Thoughts can represent the lower or bodily level of experience, or</string>
                    <string>the higher or spiritual level of experience. 3 One makes the physical, and the other creates the</string>
                    <string>spiritual.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.13. Miracles are both beginnings and endings, and so they alter the temporal order. 2 They are</string>
                    <string>always affirmations of rebirth, which seem to go back but really go forward. 3 They undo the past in</string>
                    <string>the present, and thus release the future.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.14. Miracles bear witness to truth. 2 They are convincing because they arise from conviction.</string>
                    <string>3 Without conviction they deteriorate into magic, which is mindless and therefore destructive; or</string>
                    <string>rather, the uncreative use of mind.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.15. Each day should be devoted to miracles. 2 The purpose of time is to enable you to learn</string>
                    <string>how to use time constructively. 3 It is thus a teaching device and a means to an end. 4 Time will</string>
                    <string>cease when it is no longer useful in facilitating learning.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.16. Miracles are teaching devices for demonstrating it is as blessed to give as to receive. 2</string>
                    <string>They simultaneously increase the strength of the giver and supply strength to the receiver.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.17. Miracles transcend the body. 2 They are sudden shifts into invisibility, away from the</string>
                    <string>bodily level. 3 That is why they heal.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.18. A miracle is a service. 2 It is the maximal service you can render to another. 3 It is a way</string>
                    <string>of loving your neighbor as yourself. 4 You recognize your own and your neighbor's worth</string>
                    <string>simultaneously.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.19. Miracles make minds one in God. 2 They depend on cooperation because the Sonship is</string>
                    <string>the sum of all that God created. 3 Miracles therefore reflect the laws of eternity, not of time.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.20. Miracles reawaken the awareness that the spirit, not the body, is the altar of truth. 2 This is</string>
                    <string>the recognition that leads to the healing power of the miracle.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.21. Miracles are natural signs of forgiveness. 2 Through miracles you accept God's forgiveness</string>
                    <string>by extending it to others.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.22. Miracles are associated with fear only because of the belief that darkness can hide. 2 You</string>
                    <string>believe that what your physical eyes cannot see does not exist. 3 This leads to a denial of spiritual</string>
                    <string>sight.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.23. Miracles rearrange perception and place all levels in true perspective. 2 This is healing</string>
                    <string>because sickness comes from confusing the levels.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.24. Miracles enable you to heal the sick and raise the dead because you made sickness and</string>
                    <string>death yourself, and can therefore abolish both. 2 You are a miracle, capable of creating in the</string>
                    <string>likeness of your Creator. 3 Everything else is your own nightmare, and does not exist. 4 Only the</string>
                    <string>creations of light are real.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.25. Miracles are part of an interlocking chain of forgiveness which, when completed, is the</string>
                    <string>Atonement. 2 Atonement works all the time and in all the dimensions of time.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.26. Miracles represent freedom from fear. 2 "Atoning" means "undoing." 3 The undoing of</string>
                    <string>fear is an essential part of the Atonement value of miracles.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.27. A miracle is a universal blessing from God through me to all my brothers. 2 It is the</string>
                    <string>privilege of the forgiven to forgive.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.28. Miracles are a way of earning release from fear. 2 Revelation induces a state in which fear</string>
                    <string>has already been abolished. 3 Miracles are thus a means and revelation is an end.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.29. Miracles praise God through you. 2 They praise Him by honoring His creations, affirming</string>
                    <string>their perfection. 3 They heal because they deny body-identification and affirm spirit-identification.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.30. By recognizing spirit, miracles adjust the levels of perception and show them in proper</string>
                    <string>alignment. 2 This places spirit at the center, where it can communicate directly.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.31. Miracles should inspire gratitude, not awe. 2 You should thank God for what you really</string>
                    <string>are. 3 The children of God are holy and the miracle honors their holiness, which can be hidden but</string>
                    <string>never lost.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.32. I inspire all miracles, which are really intercessions. 2 They intercede for your holiness</string>
                    <string>and make your perceptions holy. 3 By placing you beyond the physical laws they raise you into the</string>
                    <string>sphere of celestial order. 4 In this order you are perfect.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.33. Miracles honor you because you are lovable. 2 They dispel illusions about yourself and</string>
                    <string>perceive the light in you. 3 They thus atone for your errors by freeing you from your nightmares. 4</string>
                    <string>By releasing your mind from the imprisonment of your illusions, they restore your sanity.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.34. Miracles restore the mind to its fullness. 2 By atoning for lack they establish perfect</string>
                    <string>protection. 3 The spirit's strength leaves no room for intrusions.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.35. Miracles are expressions of love, but they may not always have observable effects.</string>

                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.36. Miracles are examples of right thinking, aligning your perceptions with truth as God</string>
                    <string>created it.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.37. A miracle is a correction introduced into false thinking by me. 2 It acts as a catalyst,</string>
                    <string>breaking up erroneous perception and reorganizing it properly. 3 This places you under the</string>
                    <string>Atonement principle, where perception is healed. 4 Until this has occurred, knowledge of the Divine</string>
                    <string>Order is impossible.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.38. The Holy Spirit is the mechanism of miracles. 2 He recognizes both God's creations and</string>
                    <string>your illusions. 3 He separates the true from the false by His ability to perceive totally rather than</string>
                    <string>selectively.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.39. The miracle dissolves error because the Holy Spirit identifies error as false or unreal. 2</string>
                    <string>This is the same as saying that by perceiving light, darkness automatically disappears.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                    <string>T-1.I.40. The miracle acknowledges everyone as your brother and mine. 2 It is a way of perceiving</string>
                    <string>the universal mark of God.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.I.41. Wholeness is the perceptual content of miracles. 2 They thus correct, or atone for, the</string>
                    <string>faulty perception of lack.</string>

                    <string>T-1.II.1. Revelation induces complete but temporary suspension of doubt and fear. 2 It reflects the</string>
                    <string>original form of communication between God and His creations, involving the extremely personal</string>
                    <string>sense of creation sometimes sought in physical relationships. 3 Physical closeness cannot achieve it.</string>
                    <string>4 Miracles, however, are genuinely interpersonal, and result in true closeness to others. 5 Revelation</string>
                    <string>unites you directly with God. 6 Miracles unite you directly with your brother. 7 Neither emanates</string>
                    <string>from consciousness, but both are experienced there. 8 Consciousness is the state that induces action,</string>
                    <string>though it does not inspire it. 9 You are free to believe what you choose, and what you do attests to</string>
                    <string>what you believe.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-1.II.2. Revelation is intensely personal and cannot be meaningfully translated. 2 That is why any</string>
                    <string>attempt to describe it in words is impossible. 3 Revelation induces only experience. 4 Miracles, on</string>
                    <string>the other hand, induce action. 5 They are more useful now because of their interpersonal nature. 6 In</string>
                    <string>this phase of learning, working miracles is important because freedom from fear cannot be thrust</string>
                    <string>upon you. 7 Revelation is literally unspeakable because it is an experience of unspeakable love.</string>

                    <string>T-1.II.3. Awe should be reserved for revelation, to which it is perfectly and correctly applicable. 2 It</string>
                    <string>is not appropriate for miracles because a state of awe is worshipful, implying that one of a lesser</string>
                    <string>order stands before his Creator. 3 You are a perfect creation, and should experience awe only in the</string>
                    <string>Presence of the Creator of perfection. 4 The miracle is therefore a sign of love among equals. 5</string>
                    <string>Equals should not be in awe of one another because awe implies inequality. 6 It is therefore an</string>
                    <string>inappropriate reaction to me. 7 An elder brother is entitled to respect for his greater experience, and</string>
                    <string>obedience for his greater wisdom. 8 He is also entitled to love because he is a brother, and to</string>
                    <string>devotion if he is devoted. 9 It is only my devotion that entitles me to yours. 10 There is nothing</string>
                    <string>about me that you cannot attain. 11 I have nothing that does not come from God. 12 The difference</string>
                    <string>between us now is that I have nothing else. 13 This leaves me in a state which is only potential in</string>
                    <string>you.</string>

                    <string>T-1.II.4. "No man cometh unto the Father but by me" does not mean that I am in any way separate</string>
                    <string>or different from you except in time, and time does not really exist. 2 The statement is more</string>
                    <string>meaningful in terms of a vertical rather than a horizontal axis. You stand below me and I stand</string>
                    <string>below God. 4 In the process of "rising up," I am higher because without me the distance between</string>
                    <string>God and man would be too great for you to encompass. 5 I bridge the distance as an elder brother to</string>
                    <string>you on the one hand, and as a Son of God on the other. 6 My devotion to my brothers has placed me</string>
                    <string>in charge of the Sonship, which I render complete because I share it. 7 This may appear to</string>
                    <string>contradict the statement "I and my Father are one," but there are two parts to the statement in</string>
                    <string>recognition that the Father is greater.</string>

                    <string>T-1.II.5. Revelations are indirectly inspired by me because I am close to the Holy Spirit, and alert to</string>
                    <string>the revelation-readiness of my brothers. 2 I can thus bring down to them more than they can draw</string>
                    <string>down to themselves. 3 The Holy Spirit mediates higher to lower communication, keeping the direct</string>
                    <string>channel from God to you open for revelation. 4 Revelation is not reciprocal. 5 It proceeds from God</string>
                    <string>to you, but not from you to God.</string>

                    <string>T-1.II.6. The miracle minimizes the need for time. 2 In the longitudinal or horizontal plane the</string>
                    <string>recognition of the equality of the members of the Sonship appears to involve almost endless time. 3</string>
                    <string>However, the miracle entails a sudden shift from horizontal to vertical perception. 4 This introduces</string>
                    <string>an interval from which the giver and receiver both emerge farther along in time than they would</string>
                    <string>otherwise have been. 5 The miracle thus has the unique property of abolishing time to the extent</string>
                    <string>that it renders the interval of time it spans unnecessary. 6 There is no relationship between the time</string>
                    <string>a miracle takes and the time it covers. 7 The miracle substitutes for learning that might have taken</string>
                    <string>thousands of years. 8 It does so by the underlying recognition of perfect equality of giver and</string>
                    <string>receiver on which the miracle rests. 9 The miracle shortens time by collapsing it, thus eliminating</string>
                    <string>certain intervals within it. 10 It does this, however, within the larger temporal sequence.</string>

                    <string>T-1.III.1. I am in charge of the process of Atonement, which I undertook to begin. 2 When you</string>
                    <string>offer a miracle to any of my brothers, you do it to yourself and me. 3 The reason you come before</string>
                    <string>me is that I do not need miracles for my own Atonement, but I stand at the end in case you fail</string>
                    <string>temporarily. 4 My part in the Atonement is the cancelling out of all errors that you could not</string>
                    <string>otherwise correct. 5 When you have been restored to the recognition of your original state, you</string>
                    <string>naturally become part of the Atonement yourself. 6 As you share my unwillingness to accept error in</string>
                    <string>yourself and others, you must join the great crusade to correct it; listen to my voice, learn to undo</string>
                    <string>error and act to correct it. 7 The power to work miracles belongs to you. 8 I will provide the</string>
                    <string>opportunities to do them, but you must be ready and willing. 9 Doing them will bring conviction in</string>
                    <string>the ability, because conviction comes through accomplishment. 10 The ability is the potential, the</string>
                    <string>achievement is its expression, and the Atonement, which is the natural profession of the children of</string>
                    <string>God, is the purpose.</string>

                    <string>3 You are the work of God, and His work is wholly lovable and wholly loving. 4 This is how a man</string>

                    <string>Atonement. 4 Miracles are the way in which minds that serve the Holy Spirit unite with me for the</string>

                    <string>Atonement. 2 You have a role in the Atonement which I will dictate to you. 3 Ask me which</string>
                    <string>miracles you should perform. 4 This spares you needless effort, because you will be acting under</string>
                    <string>direct communication. 5 The impersonal nature of the miracle is an essential ingredient, because it</string>
                    <string>enables me to direct its application, and under my guidance miracles lead to the highly personal</string>
                    <string>experience of revelation. 6 A guide does not control but he does direct, leaving it up to you to</string>
                    <string>follow. 7 "Lead us not into temptation" means "Recognize your errors and choose to abandon them</string>

                    <string>actually vulnerable. 3 You are free to establish your kingdom where you see fit, but the right choice</string>
                    <string>is inevitable if you remember this: 4 Spirit is in a state of grace forever. 5 Your reality is only spirit.</string>
                    <string>6 Therefore you are in a state of grace forever. 7 Atonement undoes all errors in this respect, and</string>
                    <string>thus uproots the source of fear. 8 Whenever you experience God's reassurances as threat, it is always</string>
                    <string>because you are defending misplaced or misdirected loyalty. 9 When you project this to others you</string>
                    <string>imprison them, but only to the extent to which you reinforce errors they have already made. 10 This</string>
                    <string>makes them vulnerable to the distortions of others, since their own perception of themselves is</string>
                    <string>distorted. 11 The miracle worker can only bless them, and this undoes their distortions and frees</string>

                    <string>miracles is because the Atonement itself is one, uniting all creations with their Creator. 4 As an</string>
                    <string>expression of what you truly are, the miracle places the mind in a state of grace. 5 The mind then</string>
                    <string>naturally welcomes the Host within and the stranger without. 6 When you bring in the stranger, he</string>

                    <string>chain of Atonement is welded. 3 However, this selectivity takes no account of the magnitude of the</string>
                    <string>miracle itself, because the concept of size exists on a plane that is itself unreal. 4 Since the miracle</string>
                    <string>aims at restoring the awareness of reality, it would not be useful if it were bound by laws that</string>

                    <string>hide. 2 This step usually entails fear. 3 Second, the recognition that there is nothing you want to hide</string>
                    <string>even if you could. 4 This step brings escape from fear. 5 When you have become willing to hide</string>
                    <string>nothing, you will not only be willing to enter into communion but will also understand peace and</string>

                    <string>This deception makes you fearful because you realize in your heart it is a deception, and you exert</string>
                    <string>enormous efforts to establish its reality. 3 The miracle sets reality where it belongs. 4 Reality</string>
                    <string>belongs only to spirit, and the miracle acknowledges only truth. 5 It thus dispels illusions about</string>
                    <string>yourself, and puts you in communion with yourself and God. 6 The miracle joins in the Atonement</string>
                    <string>by placing the mind in the service of the Holy Spirit. 7 This establishes the proper function of the</string>
                    <string>mind and corrects its errors, which are merely lacks of love. 8 Your mind can be possessed by</string>
                    <string>illusions, but spirit is eternally free. 9 If a mind perceives without love, it perceives an empty shell</string>
                    <string>and is unaware of the spirit within. 10 But the Atonement restores spirit to its proper place. 11 The</string>
                    <string>mind that serves spirit is invulnerable.</string>

                    <string>is an example of the "scarcity" belief, from which only error can proceed. 4 Truth is always</string>
                    <string>abundant. 5 Those who perceive and acknowledge that they have everything have no needs of any</string>
                    <string>kind. 6 The purpose of the Atonement is to restore everything to you; or rather, to restore it to your</string>

                    <string>to fulfill the law by reinterpreting it. 1 4 The law itself, if properly understood, offers only</string>
                    <string>protection. 5 It is those who have not yet changed their minds who brought the "hell-fire" concept</string>
                    <string>into it. 6 I assure you that I will witness for anyone who lets me, and to whatever extent he permits</string>
                    <string>it. 7 Your witnessing demonstrates your belief, and thus strengthens it. 8 Those who witness for me</string>
                    <string>are expressing, through their miracles, that they have abandoned the belief in deprivation in favor of</string>

                    <string>neither the body nor the miracle serves any purpose. 3 While you believe you are in a body,</string>
                    <string>however, you can choose between loveless and miraculous channels of expression. 4 You can make</string>

                    <string>necessary. 2 Time can waste as well as be wasted. 3 The miracle worker, therefore, accepts the</string>
                    <string>time-control factor gladly. 4 He recognizes that every collapse of time brings everyone closer to the</string>
                    <string>ultimate release from time, in which the Son and the Father are One. 5 Equality does not imply</string>
                    <string>equality now . 6 When everyone recognizes that he has everything, individual contributions to the</string>

                    <string>2 God is not partial. 3 All His children have His total Love, and all His gifts are freely given to</string>
                    <string>everyone alike. 4 "Except ye become as little children" means that unless you fully recognize your</string>
                    <string>complete dependence on God, you cannot know the real power of the Son in his true relationship</string>
                    <string>with the Father. 5 The specialness of God's Sons does not stem from exclusion but from inclusion. 6</string>
                    <string>All my brothers are special. 7 If they believe they are deprived of anything, their perception</string>
                    <string>becomes distorted. 8 When this occurs the whole family of God, or the Sonship, is impaired in its</string>

                    <string>return because it blesses and honors him, even though he may be absent in spirit. 3 "God is not</string>
                    <string>mocked" is not a warning but a reassurance. 4 God would be mocked if any of His creations lacked</string>
                    <string>holiness. 5 The creation is whole, and the mark of wholeness is holiness. 6 Miracles are affirmations</string>

                    <string>limit put on its choice is that it cannot serve two masters. 4 If it elects to do so, the mind can become</string>
                    <string>the medium by which spirit creates along the line of its own creation. 5 If it does not freely elect to</string>
                    <string>do so, it retains its creative potential but places itself under tyrannous rather than Authoritative</string>
                    <string>control. 6 As a result it imprisons, because such are the dictates of tyrants. 7 To change your mind</string>

                    <string>not exist in the creation of God, it is very apparent in what you have made. 4 It is, in fact, the</string>
                    <string>essential difference between them. 5 Lack implies that you would be better off in a state somehow</string>
                    <string>different from the one you are in. 6 Until the "separation," which is the meaning of the "fall,"</string>
                    <string>nothing was lacking. 7 There were no needs at all. 8 Needs arise only when you deprive yourself. 9</string>
                    <string>You act according to the particular order of needs you establish. 3 This, in turn, depends on your</string>

                    <string>perceived yourself as lacking. 3 The idea of order of needs arose because, having made this</string>
                    <string>fundamental error, you had already fragmented yourself into levels with different needs. 4 As you</string>
                    <string>integrate you become one, and your needs become one accordingly. 5 Unified needs lead to unified</string>

                    <string>can be corrected. 2 You cannot behave effectively while you function on different levels. 3</string>
                    <string>However, while you do, correction must be introduced vertically from the bottom up. 4 This is</string>
                    <string>because you think you live in space, where concepts such as "up" and "down" are meaningful. 5</string>

                    <string>7 Only perfect love exists. 8 If there is fear, It produces a state that does not exist. 4 9 Believe this</string>

                    <string>I have already referred, and which is often made. 2 I have said that awe is inappropriate in</string>
                    <string>connection with the Sons of God, because you should not experience awe in the presence of your</string>
                    <string>equals. 3 However, it was also emphasized that awe is proper in the Presence of your Creator. 4 I</string>
                    <string>have been careful to clarify my role in the Atonement without either over- or understating it. 5 I am</string>
                    <string>also trying to do the same with yours. 6 I have stressed that awe is not an appropriate reaction to me</string>
                    <string>because of our inherent equality. 7 Some of the later steps in this course, however, involve a more</string>
                    <string>direct approach to God Himself. 8 It would be unwise to start on these steps without careful</string>
                    <string>preparation, or awe will be confused with fear, and the experience will be more traumatic than</string>

                    <string>T-2.I.1. To extend is a fundamental aspect of God which He gave to His Son. 2 In the creation, God</string>
                    <string>extended Himself to His creations and imbued them with the same loving Will to create. 3 You have</string>
                    <string>not only been fully created, but have also been created perfect. 4 There is no emptiness in you. 5</string>
                    <string>Because of your likeness to your Creator you are creative. 6 No child of God can lose this ability</string>
                    <string>because it is inherent in what he is, but he can use it inappropriately by projecting. 7 The</string>
                    <string>inappropriate use of extension, or projection, occurs when you believe that some emptiness or lack</string>
                    <string>exists in you, and that you can fill it with your own ideas instead of truth. 8 This process involves</string>
                    <string>the following steps: 9 First, you believe that what God created can be changed by your own mind.</string>
                    <string>10 Second, you believe that what is perfect can be rendered imperfect or lacking. 11 Third, you</string>
                    <string>believe that you can distort the creations of God, including yourself. 12 Fourth, you believe that you</string>
                    <string>can create yourself, and that the direction of your own creation is up to you.</string>

                    <string>Everything God created is like Him. 4 Extension, as undertaken by God, is similar to the inner</string>
                    <string>radiance that the children of the Father inherit from Him. 5 Its real source is internal. 6 This is as</string>
                    <string>true of the Son as of the Father. 7 In this sense the creation includes both the creation of the Son by</string>
                    <string>God, and the Son's creations when his mind is healed. 8 This requires God's endowment of the Son</string>
                    <string>with free will, because all loving creation is freely given in one continuous line, in which all aspects</string>
                    <string>are of the same order.</string>

                    <string>was needed. 2 When Adam listened to the "lies of the serpent," all he heard was untruth. 3 You do</string>
                    <string>not have to continue to believe what is not true unless you choose to do so. 7 4 All that can literally</string>
                    <string>disappear in the twinkling of an eye because it is merely a misperception. 5 What is seen in dreams</string>
                    <string>seems to be very real. 6 Yet the Bible says that a deep sleep fell upon Adam, and nowhere is there</string>
                    <string>reference to his waking up. 7 The world has not yet experienced any comprehensive reawakening or</string>
                    <string>rebirth. 8 Such a rebirth is impossible as long as you continue to project or miscreate. 9 It still</string>
                    <string>remains within you, however, to extend as God extended His Spirit to you. 10 In reality this is your</string>
                    <string>only choice, because your free will was given you for your joy in creating the perfect.</string>

                    <string>the power of God. 2 Of course, you neither can nor have been able to do this. 3 Here is the real basis</string>
                    <string>for your escape from fear. 4 The escape is brought about by your acceptance of the Atonement,</string>
                    <string>which enables you to realize that your errors never really occurred. 5 Only after the deep sleep fell</string>
                    <string>upon Adam could he experience nightmares. 6 If a light is suddenly turned on while someone is</string>
                    <string>dreaming a fearful dream, he may initially interpret the light itself as part of his dream and be afraid</string>
                    <string>of it. 7 However, when he awakens, the light is correctly perceived as the release from the dream,</string>
                    <string>which is then no longer accorded reality. 8 This release does not depend on illusions. 9 The</string>
                    <string>knowledge that illuminates not only sets you free, but also shows you clearly that you are free.</string>

                    <string>them with equal ease. 2 It makes no distinctions among misperceptions. 3 Its sole concern is to</string>
                    <string>distinguish between truth on the one hand, and error on the other. 4 Some miracles may seem to be</string>
                    <string>of greater magnitude than others. 5 But remember the first principle in this course; there is no order</string>
                    <string>of difficulty in miracles. 6 In reality you are perfectly unaffected by all expressions of lack of love. 7</string>
                    <string>These can be from yourself and others, from yourself to others, or from others to you. 8 Peace is an</string>

                    <string>Health is inner peace. 12 It enables you to remain unshaken by lack of love from without and</string>

                    <string>T-2.II.1. You can do anything I ask. 2 I have asked you to perform miracles, and have made it clear</string>
                    <string>that miracles are natural, corrective, healing and universal. 3 There is nothing they cannot do, but</string>
                    <string>they cannot be performed in the spirit of doubt or fear. 4 When you are afraid of anything, you are</string>
                    <string>acknowledging its power to hurt you. 5 Remember that where your heart is, there is your treasure</string>
                    <string>also. 6 You believe in what you value. 7 If you are afraid, you are valuing wrongly. 8 Your</string>
                    <string>understanding will then inevitably value wrongly, and by endowing all thoughts with equal power</string>
                    <string>will inevitably destroy peace. 9 That is why the Bible speaks of "the peace of God which passeth</string>
                    <string>understanding." 10 This peace is totally incapable of being shaken by errors of any kind. 11 It</string>
                    <string>denies the ability of anything not of God to affect you. 12 This is the proper use of denial. 13 It is</string>
                    <string>not used to hide anything, but to correct error. 14 It brings all error into the light, and since error</string>
                    <string>and darkness are the same, it corrects error automatically.</string>

                    <string>T-2.II.2. True denial is a powerful protective device. 2 You can and should deny any belief that</string>
                    <string>error can hurt you. 3 This kind of denial is not a concealment but a correction. 4 Your right mind</string>
                    <string>depends on it. 5 Denial of error is a strong defense of truth, but denial of truth results in miscreation,</string>
                    <string>the projections of the ego. 6 In the service of the right mind the denial of error frees the mind, and</string>
                    <string>re-establishes the freedom of the will. 7 When the will is really free it cannot miscreate, because it</string>
                    <string>recognizes only truth.</string>

                    <string>of the goal is firmly established. 3 It is a question of what it is for. 4 Everyone defends his treasure,</string>
                    <string>and will do so automatically. 5 The real questions are, what do you treasure, and how much do you</string>
                    <string>treasure it? 6 Once you have learned to consider these questions and to bring them into all your</string>
                    <string>actions, you will have little difficulty in clarifying the means. 7 The means are available whenever</string>
                    <string>you ask. 8 You can, however, save time if you do not protract this step unduly. 9 The correct focus</string>
                    <string>will shorten it immeasurably.</string>

                    <string>device you made. 2 The Atonement principle was in effect long before the Atonement began. 3 The</string>
                    <string>principle was love and the Atonement was an act of love. 4 Acts were not necessary before the</string>
                    <string>separation, because belief in space and time did not exist. 9 5 It was only after the separation that</string>
                    <string>the Atonement and the conditions necessary for its fulfillment were planned. 6 Then a defense so</string>
                    <string>splendid was needed that it could not be misused, although it could be refused. 7 Refusal could not,</string>
                    <string>however, turn it into a weapon of attack, which is the inherent characteristic of other defenses. 8</string>
                    <string>The Atonement thus becomes the only defense that is not a two-edged sword. 9 It can only heal.</string>

                    <string>itself, and ultimately to make learning complete. 2 The Atonement is the final lesson. 3 Learning</string>
                    <string>itself, like the classrooms in which it occurs, is temporary. 4 The ability to learn has no value when</string>
                    <string>change is no longer necessary. 5 The eternally creative have nothing to learn. 6 You can learn to</string>
                    <string>improve your perceptions, and can become a better and better learner. 7 This will bring you into</string>
                    <string>closer and closer accord with the Sonship; but the Sonship itself is a perfect creation and perfection</string>
                    <string>is not a matter of degree. 8 Only while there is a belief in differences is learning meaningful.</string>

                    <string>correct your previous missteps by stepping forward. 3 This process is actually incomprehensible in</string>
                    <string>temporal terms, because you return as you go forward. 4 The Atonement is the device by which you</string>
                    <string>can free yourself from the past as you go ahead. 5 It undoes your past errors, thus making it</string>
                    <string>unnecessary for you to keep retracing your steps without advancing to your return. 6 In this sense</string>
                    <string>the Atonement saves time, but like the miracle it serves, does not abolish it. 7 As long as there is</string>
                    <string>need for Atonement, there is need for time. 8 But the Atonement as a completed plan has a unique</string>
                    <string>relationship to time. 9 Until the Atonement is complete, its various phases will proceed in time, but</string>
                    <string>the whole Atonement stands at time's end. 10 At that point the bridge of return has been built.</string>

                    <string>mistake all the separated Sons of God make in one way or another. 3 It is hard to believe a defense</string>
                    <string>that cannot attack is the best defense. 4 This is what is meant by "the meek shall inherit the earth." 5</string>
                    <string>They will literally take it over because of their strength. 6 A two-way defense is inherently weak</string>
                    <string>precisely because it has two edges, and can be turned against you very unexpectedly. 7 This</string>
                    <string>possibility cannot be controlled except by miracles. 8 The miracle turns the defense of Atonement to</string>
                    <string>your real protection, and as you become more and more secure you assume your natural talent of</string>

                    <string>separation, defenses have been used almost entirely to defend against the Atonement, and thus</string>
                    <string>maintain the separation. 3 This is generally seen as a need to protect the body. 4 The many body</string>
                    <string>fantasies in which minds engage arise from the distorted belief that the body can be used as a means</string>
                    <string>for attaining "atonement." 5 Perceiving the body as a temple is only the first step in correcting this</string>
                    <string>distortion, because it alters only part of it. 6 It does recognize that Atonement in physical terms is</string>

                    <string>structures is a sign of the fear of Atonement, and an unwillingness to reach the altar itself. 10 The</string>
                    <string>real beauty of the temple cannot be seen with the physical eye. 11 Spiritual sight, on the other hand,</string>
                    <string>cannot see the structure at all because it is perfect vision. 12 It can, however, see the altar with</string>

                    <string>invulnerable to fear, because fear did not exist. 3 Both the separation and the fear are miscreations</string>
                    <string>that must be undone for the restoration of the temple, and for the opening of the altar to receive the</string>
                    <string>Atonement. 4 This heals the separation by placing within you the one effective defense against all</string>
                    <string>separation thoughts and making you perfectly invulnerable.</string>

                    <string>to contradict free will because of the inevitability of the final decision, but this is not so. 3 You can</string>
                    <string>temporize and you are capable of enormous procrastination, but you cannot depart entirely from</string>
                    <string>your Creator, Who set the limits on your ability to miscreate. 4 An imprisoned will engenders a</string>
                    <string>situation which, in the extreme, becomes altogether intolerable. 1 5 Tolerance for pain may be high,</string>
                    <string>but it is not without limit. 6 Eventually everyone begins to recognize, however dimly, that there</string>
                    <string>must be a better way. 7 As this recognition becomes more firmly established, it becomes a turning</string>
                    <string>point. 8 This ultimately reawakens spiritual vision, simultaneously weakening the investment in</string>
                    <string>physical sight. 9 The alternating investment in the two levels of perception is usually experienced as</string>
                    <string>conflict, which can become very acute. 10 But the outcome is as certain as God.</string>

                    <string>it passes over all others, looking past error to truth. 5 Because of the strength of its vision, it brings</string>
                    <string>the mind into its service. 6 This re-establishes the power of the mind and makes it increasingly</string>
                    <string>unable to tolerate delay, realizing that it only adds unnecessary pain. 7 As a result, the mind</string>

                    <string>worthy of being offered at the altar of God, because of the value of the altar itself. 5 It was created</string>

                    <string>principle, and healing is the result. 3 To speak of "a miracle of healing" is to combine two orders of</string>
                    <string>reality inappropriately. 4 Healing is not a miracle. 5 The Atonement, or the final miracle, is a</string>
                    <string>remedy and any type of healing is a result. 6 The kind of error to which Atonement is applied is</string>
                    <string>irrelevant. 7 All healing is essentially the release from fear. 8 To undertake this you cannot be</string>

                    <string>T-2.IV.2. A major step in the Atonement plan is to undo error at all levels. 2 Sickness or "not-right-mindedness" is the result of level confusion, because it always entails the belief that what is amiss</string>
                    <string>on one level can adversely affect another. 3 We have referred to miracles as the means of correcting</string>
                    <string>level confusion, for all mistakes must be corrected at the level on which they occur. 4 Only the mind</string>
                    <string>is capable of error. 5 The body can act wrongly only when it is responding to misthought. 6 The</string>
                    <string>body cannot create, and the belief that it can, a fundamental error, produces all physical symptoms.</string>
                    <string>7 Physical illness represents a belief in magic. 8 The whole distortion that made magic rests on the</string>
                    <string>belief that there is a creative ability in matter which the mind cannot control. 9 This error can take</string>
                    <string>two forms; it can be believed that the mind can miscreate in the body, or that the body can miscreate</string>
                    <string>in the mind. 10 When it is understood that the mind, the only level of creation, cannot create beyond</string>
                    <string>itself, neither type of confusion need occur.</string>

                    <string>T-2.IV.3. Only the mind can create because spirit has already been created, and the body is a</string>
                    <string>learning device for the mind. 2 Learning devices are not lessons in themselves. 3 Their purpose is</string>
                    <string>merely to facilitate learning. 4 The worst a faulty use of a learning device can do is to fail to</string>
                    <string>facilitate learning. 5 It has no power in itself to introduce actual learning errors. 6 The body, if</string>
                    <string>properly understood, shares the invulnerability of the Atonement to two-edged application. 7 This is</string>
                    <string>not because the body is a miracle, but because it is not inherently open to misinterpretation. 8 The</string>
                    <string>body is merely part of your experience in the physical world. 9 Its abilities can be and frequently are</string>
                    <string>overevaluated. 10 However, it is almost impossible to deny its existence in this world. 11 Those</string>
                    <string>who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial. 12 The term "unworthy" here</string>
                    <string>implies only that it is not necessary to protect the mind by denying the unmindful. 3 If one denies</string>
                    <string>this unfortunate aspect of the mind's power, one is also denying the power itself.</string>

                    <string>principles. 2 This is the first step in believing that the body makes its own illness. 3 It is a second</string>
                    <string>misstep to attempt to heal it through non-creative agents. 4 It does not follow, however, that the use</string>
                    <string>of such agents for corrective purposes is evil. 5 Sometimes the illness has a sufficiently strong hold</string>
                    <string>over the mind to render a person temporarily inaccessible to the Atonement. 6 In this case it may be</string>
                    <string>wise to utilize a compromise approach to mind and body, in which something from the outside is</string>
                    <string>temporarily given healing belief. 7 This is because the last thing that can help the non-right-minded,</string>
                    <string>or the sick, is an increase in fear. 8 They are already in a fear-weakened state. 9 If they are</string>
                    <string>prematurely exposed to a miracle, they may be precipitated into panic. 10 This is likely to occur</string>
                    <string>when upside-down perception has induced the belief that miracles are frightening.</string>

                    <string>This means that a miracle, to attain its full efficacy, must be expressed in a language that the</string>

                    <string>communication of which he is capable now. 6 The whole aim of the miracle is to raise the level of</string>

                    <string>that they fully understand the fear of release. 2 Otherwise they may unwittingly foster the belief that</string>
                    <string>release is imprisonment, a belief that is already very prevalent. 3 This misperception arises in turn</string>
                    <string>from the belief that harm can be limited to the body. 4 That is because of the underlying fear that</string>
                    <string>the mind can hurt itself. 5 None of these errors is meaningful, because the miscreations of the mind</string>
                    <string>do not really exist. 6 This recognition is a far better protective device than any form of level</string>
                    <string>confusion, because it introduces correction at the level of the error. 4 7 It is essential to remember</string>
                    <string>that only the mind can create, and that correction belongs at the thought level. 8 To amplify an</string>
                    <string>earlier statement, spirit is already perfect and therefore does not require correction. 9 The body does</string>
                    <string>not exist except as a learning device for the mind. 10 This learning device is not subject to errors of</string>
                    <string>its own, because it cannot create. 11 It is obvious, then, that inducing the mind to give up its</string>

                    <string>sight will show you. 3 I said before that the Holy Spirit cannot see error, and is capable only of</string>
                    <string>looking beyond it to the defense of Atonement. 4 There is no doubt that this may produce</string>
                    <string>discomfort, yet the discomfort is not the final outcome of the perception. 5 When the Holy Spirit is</string>
                    <string>permitted to look upon the defilement of the altar, He also looks immediately toward the</string>
                    <string>Atonement. 6 Nothing He perceives can induce fear. 7 Everything that results from spiritual</string>
                    <string>awareness is merely channelized toward correction. 8 Discomfort is aroused only to bring the need</string>
                    <string>for correction into awareness.</string>

                    <string>healing is necessary. 2 What the physical eye sees is not corrective, nor can error be corrected by</string>
                    <string>any device that can be seen physically. 3 As long as you believe in what your physical sight tells</string>
                    <string>you, your attempts at correction will be misdirected. 4 The real vision is obscured, because you</string>
                    <string>cannot endure to see your own defiled altar. 5 But since the altar has been defiled, your state</string>
                    <string>becomes doubly dangerous unless it is perceived. 6</string>

                    <string>healing is needed as a means of protection. 4 This is because healing rests on charity, and charity is</string>
                    <string>a way of perceiving the perfection of another even if you cannot perceive it in yourself. 5 Most of</string>
                    <string>the loftier concepts of which you are capable now are time-dependent. 6 Charity is really a weaker</string>
                    <string>reflection of a much more powerful love-encompassment that is far beyond any form of charity you</string>
                    <string>can conceive of as yet. 7 Charity is essential to right-mindedness in the limited sense in which it can</string>

                    <string>accomplishments in time. 2 Since his own thinking is faulty he cannot see the Atonement for</string>
                    <string>himself, or he would have no need of charity. 3 The charity that is accorded him is both an</string>
                    <string>acknowledgment that he needs help, and a recognition that he will accept it. 4 Both of these</string>
                    <string>perceptions clearly imply their dependence on time, making it apparent that charity still lies within</string>
                    <string>the limitations of this world. 5 I said before that only revelation transcends time. 6 The miracle, as</string>
                    <string>an expression of charity, can only shorten it. 7 It must be understood, however, that whenever you</string>
                    <string>offer a miracle to another, you are shortening the suffering of both of you. 8 This corrects</string>

                    <string>everything that does not matter, while my guidance can direct everything that does, if you so</string>
                    <string>choose. 4 Fear cannot be controlled by me, but it can be self-controlled. 5 Fear prevents me from</string>
                    <string>giving you my control. 6 The presence of fear shows that you have raised body thoughts to the level</string>
                    <string>of the mind. 8 7 This removes them from my control, and makes you feel personally responsible for</string>

                    <string>thinking? 4 There is a confusion here that you would do well to look at clearly. 5 You may believe</string>
                    <string>that you are responsible for what you do, but not for what you think. 6 The truth is that you are</string>
                    <string>responsible for what you think, because it is only at this level that you can exercise choice. 7 What</string>
                    <string>you do comes from what you think. 8 You cannot separate yourself from the truth by "giving"</string>
                    <string>autonomy to behavior. 9 This is controlled by me automatically as soon as you place what you think</string>
                    <string>under my guidance. 10 Whenever you are afraid, it is a sure sign that you have allowed your mind to</string>

                    <string>help it. 6 You are much too tolerant of mind wandering, and are passively condoning your mind's</string>

                    <string>do. 2 This situation arises in two ways: First, you can choose to do conflicting things, either</string>
                    <string>simultaneously or successively. 3 This produces conflicted behavior, which is intolerable to you</string>
                    <string>because the part of the mind that wants to do something else is outraged. 4 Second, you can behave</string>
                    <string>as you think you should, but without entirely wanting to do so. 9 5 This produces consistent</string>
                    <string>behavior, but entails great strain. 6 In both cases, the mind and the behavior are out of accord,</string>
                    <string>resulting in a situation in which you are doing what you do not wholly want to do. 7 This arouses a</string>
                    <string>sense of coercion that usually produces rage, and projection is likely to follow. 8 Whenever there is</string>
                    <string>fear, it is because you have not made up your mind. 9 Your mind is therefore split, and your</string>
                    <string>behavior inevitably becomes erratic. 10 Correcting at the behavioral level can shift the error from</string>
                    <string>the first to the second type, but will not obliterate the fear.</string>

                    <string>cannot ask more than you are willing to do. 3 The strength to do comes from your undivided</string>
                    <string>decision. 4 There is no strain in doing God's Will as soon as you recognize that it is also your own.</string>
                    <string>5 The lesson here is quite simple, but particularly apt to be overlooked. 6 I will therefore repeat it,</string>
                    <string>urging you to listen. 7 Only your mind can produce fear. 8 It does so whenever it is conflicted in</string>
                    <string>what it wants, producing inevitable strain because wanting and doing are discordant. 9 This can be</string>

                    <string>could not have arisen. 3 Then the whole process of correction becomes nothing more than a series of</string>
                    <string>pragmatic steps in the larger process of accepting the Atonement as the remedy. 4 These steps may</string>
                    <string>be summarized in this way:</string>
                    <string>5 Know first that this is fear.</string>
                    <string>6 Fear arises from lack of love.</string>
                    <string>7 The only remedy for lack of love is perfect love.</string>

                    <string>respect from the worthy to the worthy. 2 The recognition of this worth is re-established by the</string>
                    <string>Atonement. 3 It is obvious, then, that when you are afraid, you have placed yourself in a position</string>
                    <string>where you need Atonement. 4 You have done something loveless, having chosen without love. 5</string>
                    <string>This is precisely the situation for which the Atonement was offered. 6 The need for the remedy</string>
                    <string>inspired its establishment. 7 As long as you recognize only the need for the remedy, you will remain</string>
                    <string>fearful. 0 8 However, as soon as you accept the remedy, you have abolished the fear. 9 This is how</string>

                    <string>that your thoughts cannot exert real influence because you are actually afraid of them. 11 This may</string>
                    <string>allay awareness of the guilt, but at the cost of perceiving the mind as impotent. 12 If you believe</string>
                    <string>that what you think is ineffectual you may cease to be afraid of it, but you are hardly likely to</string>
                    <string>respect it. 13 There are no idle thoughts. 14 All thinking produces form at some level.</string>

                    <string>fearful. 2 I have already indicated that you cannot ask me to release you from fear. 3 I know it does</string>
                    <string>not exist, but you do not. 4 If I intervened between your thoughts and their results, I would be</string>
                    <string>tampering with a basic law of cause and effect; the most fundamental law there is. 5 I would hardly</string>
                    <string>help you if I depreciated the power of your own thinking. 6 This would be in direct opposition to the</string>
                    <string>purpose of this course. 7 It is much more helpful to remind you that you do not guard your thoughts</string>
                    <string>carefully enough. 8 You may feel that at this point it would take a miracle to enable you to do this,</string>
                    <string>which is perfectly true. 9 You are not used to miracle-minded thinking, but you can be trained to</string>
                    <string>think that way. 10 All miracle workers need that kind of training.</string>

                    <string>working entails a full realization of the power of thought in order to avoid miscreation. 3 Otherwise</string>
                    <string>a miracle will be necessary to set the mind itself straight, a circular process that would not foster the</string>
                    <string>time collapse for which the miracle was intended. 1 4 The miracle worker must have genuine</string>
                    <string>respect for true cause and effect as a necessary condition for the miracle to occur.</string>

                    <string>T-2.VII.3. Both miracles and fear come from thoughts. 2 If you are not free to choose one, you</string>
                    <string>would also not be free to choose the other. 3 By choosing the miracle you have rejected fear, if only</string>
                    <string>temporarily. 4 You have been fearful of everyone and everything. 5 You are afraid of God, of me</string>
                    <string>and of yourself. 6 You have misperceived or miscreated Us, and believe in what you have made. 7</string>
                    <string>You would not have done this if you were not afraid of your own thoughts. 8 The fearful must</string>
                    <string>miscreate, because they misperceive creation. 9 When you miscreate you are in pain. 10 The cause</string>
                    <string>and effect principle now becomes a real expediter, though only temporarily. 11 Actually, "Cause" is</string>
                    <string>a term properly belonging to God, and His "Effect" is His Son. 12 This entails a set of Cause and</string>
                    <string>Effect relationships totally different from those you introduce into miscreation. 13 The fundamental</string>
                    <string>conflict in this world, then, is between creation and miscreation. 14 All fear is implicit in the</string>
                    <string>second, and all love in the first. 15 The conflict is therefore one between love and fear.</string>

                    <string>T-2.VII.4. It has already been said that you believe you cannot control fear because you yourself</string>
                    <string>made it, and your belief in it seems to render it out of your control. 2 Yet any attempt to resolve the</string>
                    <string>error through attempting the mastery of fear is useless. 3 In fact, it asserts the power of fear by the</string>
                    <string>very assumption that it need be mastered. 4 The true resolution rests entirely on mastery through</string>
                    <string>love. 5 In the interim, however, the sense of conflict is inevitable, since you have placed yourself in</string>
                    <string>a position where you believe in the power of what does not exist.</string>

                    <string>T-2.VII.5. Nothing and everything cannot coexist. 2 To believe in one is to deny the other. 3 Fear is</string>
                    <string>really nothing and love is everything. 4 Whenever light enters darkness, the darkness is abolished. 5</string>
                    <string>What you believe is true for you. 6 In this sense the separation has occurred, and to deny it is</string>
                    <string>merely to use denial inappropriately. 7 However, to concentrate on error is only a further error. 8</string>
                    <string>The initial corrective procedure is to recognize temporarily that there is a problem, but only as an</string>
                    <string>indication that immediate correction is needed. 9 This establishes a state of mind in which the</string>
                    <string>Atonement can be accepted without delay. 10 It should be emphasized, however, that ultimately no</string>
                    <string>compromise is possible between everything and nothing. 11 Time is essentially a device by which</string>
                    <string>all compromise in this respect can be given up 2. 12 It only seems to be abolished by degrees,</string>
                    <string>because time itself involves intervals that do not exist. 13 Miscreation made this necessary as a</string>
                    <string>corrective device. 14 The statement "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,</string>
                    <string>that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life" needs only one slight</string>
                    <string>correction to be meaningful in this context; "He gave it to His only begotten Son."</string>

                    <string>T-2.VII.6. It should especially be noted that God has only one Son. 2 If all His creations are His</string>
                    <string>Sons, every one must be an integral part of the whole Sonship. 3 The Sonship in its Oneness</string>
                    <string>transcends the sum of its parts. 4 However, this is obscured as long as any of its parts is missing. 5</string>
                    <string>That is why the conflict cannot ultimately be resolved until all the parts of the Sonship have</string>
                    <string>returned. 6 Only then can the meaning of wholeness in the true sense be understood. 7 Any part of</string>
                    <string>the Sonship can believe in error or incompleteness if he so chooses. 8 However, if he does so, he is</string>
                    <string>believing in the existence of nothingness. 9 The correction of this error is the Atonement.</string>

                    <string>T-2.VII.7. I have already briefly spoken about readiness, but some additional points might be</string>
                    <string>helpful here. 2 Readiness is only the prerequisite for accomplishment. 3 The two should not be</string>
                    <string>confused. 4 As soon as a state of readiness occurs, there is usually some degree of desire to</string>
                    <string>accomplish, but it is by no means necessarily undivided. 5 The state does not imply more than a</string>
                    <string>potential for a change of mind. 6 Confidence cannot develop fully until mastery has been</string>
                    <string>accomplished. 7 We have already attempted to correct the fundamental error that fear can be</string>
                    <string>mastered, and have emphasized that the only real mastery is through love. 8 Readiness is only the</string>
                    <string>beginning of confidence. 9 You may think this implies that an enormous amount of time is</string>
                    <string>necessary between readiness and mastery, but let me remind you that time and space are under my</string>
                    <string>control.</string>

                    <string>T-2.VIII.1. One of the ways in which you can correct the magic-miracle confusion is to remember</string>
                    <string>that you did not create yourself. 2 You are apt to forget this when you become egocentric, and this</string>
                    <string>puts you in a position where a belief in magic is virtually inevitable. 3 3 Your will to create was</string>
                    <string>given you by your Creator, Who was expressing the same Will in His creation. 4 Since creative</string>
                    <string>ability rests in the mind, everything you create is necessarily a matter of will. 5 It also follows that</string>
                    <string>whatever you alone make is real in your own sight, though not in the Mind of God. 6 This basic</string>
                    <string>distinction leads directly into the real meaning of the Last Judgment.</string>

                    <string>T-2.VIII.2. The Last Judgment is one of the most threatening ideas in your thinking. 2 This is</string>
                    <string>because you do not understand it. 3 Judgment is not an attribute of God. 4 It was brought into being</string>
                    <string>only after the separation, when it became one of the many learning devices to be built into the</string>
                    <string>overall plan. 5 Just as the separation occurred over millions of years, the Last Judgment will extend</string>
                    <string>over a similarly long period, and perhaps an even longer one. 6 Its length can, however, be greatly</string>
                    <string>shortened by miracles, the device for shortening but not abolishing time. 7 If a sufficient number</string>
                    <string>become truly miracle-minded, this shortening process can be virtually immeasurable. 8 It is</string>
                    <string>essential, however, that you free yourself from fear quickly, because you must emerge from the</string>
                    <string>conflict if you are to bring peace to other minds.</string>

                    <string>T-2.VIII.3. The Last Judgment is generally thought of as a procedure undertaken by God. 2 Actually</string>
                    <string>it will be undertaken by my brothers with my help. 3 It is a final healing rather than a meting out of</string>
                    <string>punishment, however much you may think that punishment is deserved. 4 Punishment is a concept</string>
                    <string>totally opposed to right-mindedness, and the aim of the Last Judgment is to restore rightmindedness to you. 5 The Last Judgment might be called a process of right evaluation. 6 It simply</string>
                    <string>means that everyone will finally come to understand what is worthy and what is not. 7 After this,</string>
                    <string>the ability to choose can be directed rationally. 8 Until this distinction is made, however, the</string>
                    <string>vacillations between free and imprisoned will cannot but continue.</string>

                    <string>T-2.VIII.4. The first step toward freedom involves a sorting out of the false from the true. 2 This is</string>
                    <string>a process of separation in the constructive sense, and reflects the true meaning of the Apocalypse. 3</string>
                    <string>Everyone will ultimately look upon his own creations and choose to preserve only what is good, just</string>
                    <string>as God Himself looked upon what He had created and knew that it was good. 4 At this point, the</string>
                    <string>mind can begin to look with love on its own creations because of their worthiness. 5 At the same</string>
                    <string>time the mind will inevitably disown its miscreations which, without belief, will no longer exist. 4</string>

                    <string>T-2.VIII.5. The term "Last Judgment" is frightening not only because it has been projected onto</string>
                    <string>God, but also because of the association of "last" with death. 2 This is an outstanding example of</string>
                    <string>upside-down perception. 3 If the meaning of the Last Judgment is objectively examined, it is quite</string>
                    <string>apparent that it is really the doorway to life. 4 No one who lives in fear is really alive. 5 Your own</string>
                    <string>last judgment cannot be directed toward yourself, because you are not your own creation. 6 You</string>
                    <string>can, however, apply it meaningfully and at any time to everything you have made, and retain in</string>
                    <string>your memory only what is creative and good. 7 This is what your right-mindedness cannot but</string>
                    <string>dictate. 8 The purpose of time is solely to "give you time" to achieve this judgment. 9 It is your own</string>
                    <string>perfect judgment of your own perfect creations. 10 When everything you retain is lovable, there is</string>

                    <string>can disappear. 2 The crucifixion did not establish the Atonement; the resurrection did. 3 Many</string>
                    <string>sincere Christians have misunderstood this. 4 No one who is free of the belief in scarcity could</string>
                    <string>possibly make this mistake. 5 If the crucifixion is seen from an upside-down point of view, it does</string>
                    <string>appear as if God permitted and even encouraged one of His Sons to suffer because he was good. 6</string>
                    <string>This particularly unfortunate interpretation, which arose out of projection, has led many people to be</string>

                    <string>to justify it. 3 This procedure is painful in its minor applications and genuinely tragic on a wider</string>
                    <string>scale. 4 Persecution frequently results in an attempt to "justify" the terrible misperception that God</string>

                    <string>it is subject to either fear or love. 8 Misperceptions produce fear and true perceptions foster love, but</string>
                    <string>neither brings certainty because all perception varies. 9 That is why it is not knowledge. 10 True</string>
                    <string>perception is the basis for knowledge, but knowing is the affirmation of truth and beyond all</string>

                    <string>T-3.IV.1. The abilities you now possess are only shadows of your real strength. 2 All of your</string>
                    <string>present functions are divided and open to question and doubt. 3 This is because you are not certain</string>
                    <string>how you will use them, and are therefore incapable of knowledge. 1 4 You are also incapable of</string>
                    <string>knowledge because you can still perceive lovelessly. 5 Perception did not exist until the separation</string>
                    <string>introduced degrees, aspects and intervals. 6 Spirit has no levels, and all conflict arises from the</string>
                    <string>concept of levels. 7 Only the Levels of the Trinity are capable of unity. 8 The levels created by the</string>
                    <string>separation cannot but conflict. 9 This is because they are meaningless to each other.</string>

                    <string>T-3.IV.2. Consciousness, the level of perception, was the first split introduced into the mind after</string>
                    <string>the separation, making the mind a perceiver rather than a creator. 2 Consciousness is correctly</string>
                    <string>identified as the domain of the ego. 3 The ego is a wrong-minded attempt to perceive yourself as</string>
                    <string>you wish to be, rather than as you are. 4 Yet you can know yourself only as you are, because that is</string>
                    <string>all you can be sure of. 5 Everything else is open to question.</string>

                    <string>T-3.IV.3. The ego is the questioning aspect of the post-separation self, which was made rather than</string>
                    <string>created. 2 It is capable of asking questions but not of perceiving meaningful answers, because these</string>
                    <string>would involve knowledge and cannot be perceived. 3 The mind is therefore confused, because only</string>
                    <string>One-mindedness can be without confusion. 4 A separated or divided mind must be confused. 5 It is</string>
                    <string>necessarily uncertain about what it is. 6 It has to be in conflict because it is out of accord with itself.</string>
                    <string>7 This makes its aspects strangers to each other, and this is the essence of the fear-prone condition,</string>
                    <string>in which attack is always possible. 8 You have every reason to feel afraid as you perceive yourself.</string>
                    <string>9 This is why you cannot escape from fear until you realize that you did not and could not create</string>
                    <string>yourself. 10 You can never make your misperceptions true, and your creation is beyond your own</string>
                    <string>error. 11 That is why you must eventually choose to heal the separation.</string>

                    <string>only to right perception. 2 You can be right-minded or wrong-minded, and even this is subject to</string>
                    <string>degrees, clearly demonstrating that knowledge is not involved. 3 The term "right-mindedness" is</string>
                    <string>properly used as the correction for "wrong-mindedness," and applies to the state of mind that</string>
                    <string>induces accurate perception. 4 It is miracle-minded because it heals misperception, and this is indeed</string>
                    <string>a miracle in view of how you perceive yourself.</string>

                    <string>T-3.IV.5. Perception always involves some misuse of mind, because it brings the mind into areas of</string>
                    <string>uncertainty. 2 The mind is very active 2. 3 When it chooses to be separated it chooses to perceive. 4</string>
                    <string>Until then it wills only to know. 5 Afterwards it can only choose ambiguously, and the only way out</string>
                    <string>of ambiguity is clear perception. 6 The mind returns to its proper function only when it wills to</string>
                    <string>know. 7 This places it in the service of spirit, where perception is changed. 8 The mind chooses to</string>
                    <string>divide itself when it chooses to make its own levels. 9 But it could not entirely separate itself from</string>
                    <string>spirit, because it is from spirit that it derives its whole power to make or create. 10 Even in</string>
                    <string>miscreation the mind is affirming its Source, or it would merely cease to be. 11 This is impossible,</string>
                    <string>because the mind belongs to spirit which God created and which is therefore eternal.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-3.IV.6. The ability to perceive made the body possible, because you must perceive something and</string>
                    <string>with something. 2 That is why perception involves an exchange or translation, which knowledge</string>
                    <string>does not need. 3 The interpretative function of perception, a distorted form of creation, then permits</string>
                    <string>you to interpret the body as yourself in an attempt to escape from the conflict you have induced. 4</string>
                    <string>Spirit, which knows, could not be reconciled with this loss of power, because it is incapable of</string>
                    <string>darkness. 5 This makes spirit almost inaccessible to the mind and entirely inaccessible to the body. 6</string>
                    <string>Thereafter, spirit is perceived as a threat, because light abolishes darkness merely by showing you it</string>
                    <string>is not there. 7 Truth will always overcome error in this way. 8 This cannot be an active process of</string>
                    <string>correction because, as I have already emphasized, knowledge does not do anything. 9 It can be</string>
                    <string>perceived as an attacker, but it cannot attack. 10 What you perceive as its attack is your own vague</string>
                    <string>recognition that knowledge can always be remembered, never having been destroyed.</string>

                    <string>T-3.IV.7. God and His creations remain in surety, and therefore know that no miscreation exists. 2</string>
                    <string>Truth cannot deal with errors that you want. 3 I was a man who remembered spirit and its</string>
                    <string>knowledge. 4 As a man I did not attempt to counteract error with knowledge, but to correct error</string>
                    <string>from the bottom up. 5 I demonstrated both the powerlessness of the body and the power of the</string>
                    <string>mind. 6 By uniting my will with that of my Creator, I naturally remembered spirit and its real</string>
                    <string>purpose. 7 I cannot unite your will with God's for you, but I can erase all misperceptions from your</string>
                    <string>mind if you will bring it under my guidance. 8 Only your misperceptions stand in your way. 9</string>
                    <string>Without them your choice is certain. 10 Sane perception induces sane choosing. 11 I cannot choose</string>
                    <string>for you, but I can help you make your own right choice. 3 12 "Many are called but few are chosen"</string>
                    <string>should be, "All are called but few choose to listen." 13 Therefore, they do not choose right. 14 The</string>
                    <string>"chosen ones" are merely those who choose right sooner. 15 Right minds can do this now, and they</string>
                    <string>will find rest unto their souls. 16 God knows you only in peace, and this is your reality.</string>

                    <string>perception, which is inherently judgmental, was introduced only after the separation. 2 No one has</string>
                    <string>been sure of anything since. 3 I have also made it clear that the resurrection was the means for the</string>
                    <string>return to knowledge, which was accomplished by the union of my will with the Father's. 4 We can</string>

                    <string>make something, you do so out of a specific sense of lack or need. 3 Anything made for a specific</string>
                    <string>purpose has no true generalizability. 4 When you make something to fill a perceived lack, you are</string>
                    <string>tacitly implying that you believe in separation. 5 The ego has invented many ingenious thought</string>
                    <string>systems for this purpose. 6 None of them is creative. 7 Inventiveness is wasted effort even in its</string>
                    <string>most ingenious form. 8 The highly specific nature of invention is not worthy of the abstract</string>

                    <string>your real creation and what you have made of yourself is so profound that it has become literally</string>
                    <string>impossible for you to know anything. 3 Knowledge is always stable, and it is quite evident that you</string>
                    <string>are not. 4 Nevertheless, you are perfectly stable as God created you. 5 In this sense, when your</string>
                    <string>behavior is unstable, you are disagreeing with God's idea of your creation. 6 You can do this if you</string>
                    <string>choose, but you would hardly want to do it if you were in your right mind.</string>

                    <string>yourself at all. 2 You keep asking what it is you are. 3 This implies that the answer is not only one</string>
                    <string>you know, but is also one that is up to you to supply. 4 Yet you cannot perceive yourself correctly. 4</string>
                    <string>5 You have no image to be perceived. 6 The word "image" is always perception-related, and not a</string>
                    <string>part of knowledge. 7 Images are symbolic and stand for something else. 8 The idea of "changing</string>
                    <string>your image" recognizes the power of perception, but also implies that there is nothing stable to</string>

                    <string>always open to error because it refers to the perception of meaning. 3 Such incongruities are the</string>
                    <string>result of attempts to regard yourself as separated and unseparated at the same time. 4 It is</string>
                    <string>impossible to make so fundamental a confusion without increasing your overall confusion still</string>
                    <string>further. 5 Your mind may have become very ingenious, but as always happens when method and</string>
                    <string>content are separated, it is utilized in a futile attempt to escape from an inescapable impasse. 6</string>
                    <string>Ingenuity is totally divorced from knowledge, because knowledge does not require ingenuity. 7</string>

                    <string>Once forgiveness has been accepted, prayer in the usual sense becomes utterly meaningless. 5 The</string>
                    <string>prayer for forgiveness is nothing more than a request that you may be able to recognize what you</string>
                    <string>already have. 6 In electing perception instead of knowledge, you placed yourself in a position where</string>
                    <string>you could resemble your Father only by perceiving miraculously. 7 You have lost the knowledge</string>
                    <string>that you yourself are a miracle of God. 8 Creation is your Source and your only real function.</string>

                    <string>"Image" can be understood as "thought," and "likeness" as "of a like quality." 3 God did create spirit</string>

                    <string>selectivity. 7 Perception is a continual process of accepting and rejecting, organizing and</string>
                    <string>reorganizing, shifting and changing. 8 Evaluation is an essential part of perception, because</string>

                    <string>the process on which perception but not knowledge rests. 3 I have discussed this before in terms of</string>
                    <string>the selectivity of perception, pointing out that evaluation is its obvious prerequisite. 4 Judgment</string>
                    <string>always involves rejection. 5 It never emphasizes only the positive aspects of what is judged, whether</string>
                    <string>in you or in others. 6 6 What has been perceived and rejected, or judged and found wanting,</string>
                    <string>remains in your mind because it has been perceived. 7 One of the illusions from which you suffer is</string>
                    <string>the belief that what you judged against has no effect. 8 This cannot be true unless you also believe</string>
                    <string>that what you judged against does not exist. 9 You evidently do not believe this, or you would not</string>
                    <string>have judged against it. 10 In the end it does not matter whether your judgment is right or wrong. 11</string>
                    <string>Either way you are placing your belief in the unreal. 12 This cannot be avoided in any type of</string>
                    <string>judgment, because it implies the belief that reality is yours to select from.</string>

                    <string>meaning is lost to you precisely because you are judging them. 4 All uncertainty comes from the</string>

                    <string>problem, it is always because you believe you are the author of yourself and project your delusion</string>
                    <string>onto others. 3 You then perceive the situation as one in which others are literally fighting you for</string>
                    <string>your authorship. 4 This is the fundamental error of all those who believe they have usurped the</string>
                    <string>power of God. 5 This belief is very frightening to them, but hardly troubles God. 6 He is, however,</string>
                    <string>eager to undo it, not to punish His children, but only because He knows that it makes them unhappy.</string>
                    <string>7 God's creations are given their true Authorship, but you prefer to be anonymous when you choose</string>
                    <string>to separate yourself from your Author. 8 Being uncertain of your true Authorship, you believe that</string>
                    <string>your creation was anonymous. 9 This leaves you in a position where it sounds meaningful to believe</string>
                    <string>that you created yourself. 10 The dispute over authorship has left such uncertainty in your mind that</string>

                    <string>3 The belief that they are is implicit in the "self-concept," or the tendency of the self to make an</string>
                    <string>image of itself. 4 Images are perceived, not known. 5 Knowledge cannot deceive, but perception</string>

                    <string>properly understood is the opposite of fatigue. 6 To be fatigued is to be dis-spirited, but to be</string>
                    <string>inspired is to be in the spirit. 7 To be egocentric is to be dis-spirited, but to be Self-centered in the</string>
                    <string>right sense is to be inspired or in spirit. 8 The truly inspired are enlightened and cannot abide in</string>

                    <string>you have chosen to "Be still and know that I am God." 3 These words are inspired because they</string>
                    <string>reflect knowledge. 4 If you speak from the ego you are disclaiming knowledge instead of affirming</string>
                    <string>it, and are thus dis-spiriting yourself. 5 Do not embark on useless journeys, because they are indeed</string>
                    <string>in vain. 6 The ego may desire them, but spirit cannot embark on them because it is forever unwilling</string>

                    <string>T-4.in.3. The journey to the cross should be the last "useless journey." 2 Do not dwell upon it, but</string>
                    <string>dismiss it as accomplished. 3 If you can accept it as your own last useless journey, you are also free</string>
                    <string>to join my resurrection. 4 Until you do so your life is indeed wasted. 5 It merely re-enacts the</string>
                    <string>separation, the loss of power, the futile attempts of the ego at reparation, and finally the crucifixion</string>
                    <string>of the body, or death. 6 Such repetitions are endless until they are voluntarily given up. 7 Do not</string>
                    <string>make the pathetic error of "clinging to the old rugged cross." 8 The only message of the crucifixion</string>
                    <string>is that you can overcome the cross. 9 Until then you are free to crucify yourself as often as you</string>
                    <string>choose. 10 This is not the gospel I intended to offer you. 11 We have another journey to undertake,</string>

                    <string>T-4.I.1. A good teacher clarifies his own ideas and strengthens them by teaching them. 2 Teacher</string>
                    <string>and pupil are alike in the learning process. 3 They are in the same order of learning, and unless they</string>
                    <string>share their lessons conviction will be lacking. 4 A good teacher must believe in the ideas he teaches,</string>
                    <string>but he must meet another condition; he must believe in the students to whom he offers the ideas.</string>

                    <string>T-4.I.2. Many stand guard over their ideas because they want to protect their thought systems as</string>
                    <string>they are, and learning means change. 2 Change is always fearful to the separated, because they</string>
                    <string>cannot conceive of it as a move towards healing the separation. 3 They always perceive it as a move</string>
                    <string>toward further separation, because the separation was their first experience of change. 4 You believe</string>
                    <string>that if you allow no change to enter into your ego you will find peace. 5 This profound confusion is</string>
                    <string>possible only if you maintain that the same thought system can stand on two foundations. 6 Nothing</string>
                    <string>can reach spirit from the ego, and nothing can reach the ego from spirit. 7 Spirit can neither</string>
                    <string>strengthen the ego nor reduce the conflict within it. 8 The ego is a contradiction. 9 Your self and</string>
                    <string>God's Self are in opposition. 10 They are opposed in source, in direction and in outcome. 11 They</string>
                    <string>are fundamentally irreconcilable, because spirit cannot perceive and the ego cannot know. 12 They</string>
                    <string>are therefore not in communication and can never be in communication. 13 Nevertheless, the ego</string>
                    <string>can learn, even though its maker can be misguided. 14 He cannot, however, make the totally lifeless</string>
                    <string>out of the life-given.</string>

                    <string>T-4.I.3. Spirit need not be taught, but the ego must be. 2 Learning is ultimately perceived as</string>
                    <string>frightening because it leads to the relinquishment, not the destruction, of the ego to the light of</string>
                    <string>spirit. 3 This is the change the ego must fear, because it does not share my charity. 4 My lesson was</string>
                    <string>like yours, and because I learned it I can teach it. 5 I will never attack your ego, but I am trying to</string>
                    <string>teach you how its thought system arose. 6 When I remind you of your true creation, your ego cannot</string>
                    <string>but respond with fear.</string>

                    <string>your mind and help others to change theirs. 2 Refusing to change your mind will not prove that the</string>
                    <string>separation has not occurred. 3 The dreamer who doubts the reality of his dream while he is still</string>
                    <string>dreaming is not really healing his split mind. 3 4 You dream of a separated ego and believe in a</string>
                    <string>world that rests upon it. 5 This is very real to you. 6 You cannot undo it by not changing your mind</string>
                    <string>about it. 7 If you are willing to renounce the role of guardian of your thought system and open it to</string>
                    <string>me, I will correct it very gently and lead you back to God.</string>

                    <string>T-4.I.5. Every good teacher hopes to give his students so much of his own learning that they will</string>
                    <string>one day no longer need him. 2 This is the one true goal of the teacher. 3 It is impossible to convince</string>
                    <string>the ego of this, because it goes against all of its own laws. 4 But remember that laws are set up to</string>
                    <string>protect the continuity of the system in which the lawmaker believes. 5 It is natural for the ego to try</string>
                    <string>to protect itself once you have made it, but it is not natural for you to want to obey its laws unless</string>
                    <string>you believe them. 6 The ego cannot make this choice because of the nature of its origin. 7 You can,</string>
                    <string>because of the nature of yours.</string>

                    <string>T-4.I.6. Egos can clash in any situation, but spirit cannot clash at all. 2 If you perceive a teacher as</string>
                    <string>merely "a larger ego" you will be afraid, because to enlarge an ego would be to increase anxiety</string>
                    <string>about separation. 3 I will teach with you and live with you if you will think with me, but my goal</string>
                    <string>will always be to absolve you finally from the need for a teacher. 4 This is the opposite of the ego-oriented teacher's goal. 5 He is concerned with the effect of his ego on other egos, and therefore</string>
                    <string>interprets their interaction as a means of ego preservation. 6 I would not be able to devote myself to</string>
                    <string>teaching if I believed this, and you will not be a devoted teacher as long as you believe it. 7 I am</string>
                    <string>constantly being perceived as a teacher either to be exalted or rejected, but I do not accept either</string>
                    <string>perception for myself.</string>

                    <string>T-4.I.7. Your worth is not established by teaching or learning. 2 Your worth is established by God.</string>
                    <string>3 As long as you dispute this everything you do will be fearful, particularly any situation that lends</string>
                    <string>itself to the belief in superiority and inferiority. 4 Teachers must be patient and repeat their lessons</string>
                    <string>until they are learned. 5 I am willing to do this, because I have no right to set your learning limits</string>
                    <string>for you. 6 Again,--nothing you do or think or wish or make is necessary to establish your worth. 7</string>
                    <string>This point is not debatable except in delusions. 8 Your ego is never at stake because God did not</string>
                    <string>create it. 9 Your spirit is never at stake because He did. 10 Any confusion on this point is delusional,</string>
                    <string>and no form of devotion is possible as long as this delusion lasts.</string>

                    <string>T-4.I.8. The ego tries to exploit all situations into forms of praise for itself in order to overcome its</string>
                    <string>doubts. 4 2 It will remain doubtful as long as you believe in its existence. 3 You who made it cannot</string>
                    <string>trust it, because in your right mind you realize it is not real. 4 The only sane solution is not to try to</string>
                    <string>change reality, which is indeed a fearful attempt, but to accept it as it is. 5 You are part of reality,</string>
                    <string>which stands unchanged beyond the reach of your ego but within easy reach of spirit. 6 When you</string>
                    <string>are afraid, be still and know that God is real, and you are His beloved Son in whom He is well</string>
                    <string>pleased. 7 Do not let your ego dispute this, because the ego cannot know what is as far beyond its</string>

                    <string>T-4.I.9. God is not the author of fear. 2 You are. 3 You have chosen to create unlike Him, and have</string>
                    <string>therefore made fear for yourself. 4 You are not at peace because you are not fulfilling your function.</string>
                    <string>5 God gave you a very lofty function that you are not meeting. 6 Your ego has chosen to be afraid</string>
                    <string>instead of meeting it. 7 When you awaken you will not be able to understand this, because it is</string>
                    <string>literally incredible. 8 Do not believe the incredible now. 9 Any attempt to increase its believableness</string>
                    <string>is merely to postpone the inevitable. 10 The word "inevitable" is fearful to the ego, but joyous to the</string>
                    <string>spirit. 11 God is inevitable, and you cannot avoid Him any more than He can avoid you.</string>

                    <string>withdraw all protection from the ego, and become totally without investment in fear. 2 Your</string>
                    <string>investment is great now because fear is a witness to the separation, and your ego rejoices when you</string>
                    <string>witness to it. 3 Leave it behind! 4 Do not listen to it and do not preserve it. 5 Listen only to God,</string>
                    <string>Who is as incapable of deception as is the spirit He created. 6 Release yourself and release others. 7</string>
                    <string>Do not present a false and unworthy picture of yourself to others, and do not accept such a picture</string>

                    <string>Only God could make a home that is worthy of His creations, who have chosen to leave it empty by</string>
                    <string>their own dispossession. 5 Yet His home will stand forever, and is ready for you when you choose</string>
                    <string>to enter it. 6 Of this you can be wholly certain. 7 God is as incapable of creating the perishable as</string>

                    <string>beyond humility, because it recognizes its radiance and gladly sheds its light everywhere. 4 The</string>

                    <string>because the past does not matter, and history would not exist if the same errors were not being</string>
                    <string>repeated in the present. 4 Abstract thought applies to knowledge because knowledge is completely</string>
                    <string>impersonal, and examples are irrelevant to its understanding. 5 Perception, however, is always</string>

                    <string>because of its instability. 2 He also makes an ego for everyone else he perceives, which is equally</string>
                    <string>variable. 6 3 Their interaction is a process that alters both, because they were not made by or with</string>
                    <string>the Unalterable. 4 It is important to realize that this alteration can and does occur as readily when</string>
                    <string>the interaction takes place in the mind as when it involves physical proximity. 5 Thinking about</string>

                    <string>and charity. 5 Your reactions to the self you made are not surprising. 6 In fact, they resemble in</string>

                    <string>is obvious when you consider what is involved. 3 To the ego, to give anything implies that you will</string>
                    <string>have to do without it. 4 When you associate giving with sacrifice, you give only because you believe</string>
                    <string>that you are somehow getting something better, and can therefore do without the thing you give. 5</string>
                    <string>"Giving to get" is an inescapable law of the ego, which always evaluates itself in relation to other</string>
                    <string>egos. 6 It is therefore continually preoccupied with the belief in scarcity that gave rise to it. 7 Its</string>
                    <string>whole perception of other egos as real is only an attempt to convince itself that it is real. 8 "Self-esteem" in ego terms means nothing more than that the ego has deluded itself into accepting its</string>
                    <string>reality, and is therefore temporarily less predatory. 9 This "self-esteem" is always vulnerable to</string>

                    <string>That is why the concept of "getting" arose in the ego's thought system. 5 Appetites are "getting"</string>
                    <string>mechanisms, representing the ego's need to confirm itself. 6 This is as true of body appetites as it is</string>
                    <string>of the so-called "higher ego needs." 7 Body appetites are not physical in origin. 8 The ego regards</string>
                    <string>the body as its home, and tries to satisfy itself through the body. 9 But the idea that this is possible</string>
                    <string>is a decision of the mind, which has become completely confused about what is really possible.</string>

                    <string>unite with them in a feeble attempt at identification, or attack them in an equally feeble show of</string>
                    <string>strength. 3 It is not free, however, to open the premise to question, because the premise is its</string>
                    <string>foundation. 4 The ego is the mind's belief that it is completely on its own. 5 The ego's ceaseless</string>
                    <string>attempts to gain the spirit's acknowledgment and thus establish its own existence are useless. 6</string>
                    <string>Spirit in its knowledge is unaware of the ego. 7 It does not attack it; it merely cannot conceive of it</string>
                    <string>at all. 8 While the ego is equally unaware of spirit, it does perceive itself as being rejected by</string>
                    <string>something greater than itself. 9 This is why self-esteem in ego terms must be delusional. 10 The</string>
                    <string>creations of God do not create myths, although creative effort can be turned to mythology. 8 It can</string>
                    <string>do so, however, only under one condition; what it makes is then no longer creative. 12 Myths are</string>
                    <string>entirely perceptual, and so ambiguous in form and characteristically good-and-evil in nature that the</string>

                    <string>that the ego existed before that point in time. 5 The more "religiously" ego-oriented may believe that</string>
                    <string>the soul existed before, and will continue to exist after a temporary lapse into ego life. 6 Some even</string>
                    <string>believe that the soul will be punished for this lapse. 7 However, salvation does not apply to spirit,</string>

                    <string>perception is a steppingstone towards it. 3 The whole value of right perception lies in the inevitable</string>

                    <string>afraid. 4 In the ego's language, "to have" and "to be" are different, but they are identical to the Holy</string>

                    <string>you have done and left undone accordingly, and then change your mind to think with God's. 6 This</string>
                    <string>may seem hard to do, but it is much easier than trying to think against it. 7 Your mind is one with</string>

                    <string>3 The ego exerts maximal vigilance about what it permits into awareness, and this is not the way a</string>
                    <string>balanced mind holds together. 4 The ego is thrown further off balance because it keeps its primary</string>
                    <string>motivation from your awareness, and raises control rather than sanity to predominance. 5 The ego</string>
                    <string>has every reason to do this, according to the thought system which gave rise to it and which it</string>
                    <string>serves. 6 Sane judgment would inevitably judge against the ego, and must be obliterated by the ego</string>

                    <string>T-4.V.2. A major source of the ego's off-balanced state is its lack of discrimination between the</string>
                    <string>body and the Thoughts of God. 2 Thoughts of God are unacceptable to the ego, because they clearly</string>
                    <string>point to the nonexistence of the ego itself. 3 The ego therefore either distorts them or refuses to</string>
                    <string>accept them. 4 It cannot, however, make them cease to be. 5 It therefore tries to conceal not only</string>
                    <string>"unacceptable" body impulses, but also the Thoughts of God, because both are threatening to it. 6</string>
                    <string>Being concerned primarily with its own preservation in the face of threat, the ego perceives them as</string>
                    <string>the same. 7 By perceiving them as the same, the ego attempts to save itself from being swept away,</string>
                    <string>as it would surely be in the presence of knowledge.</string>

                    <string>is essential to the ego, which judges only in terms of threat or non-threat to itself. 3 In one sense the</string>
                    <string>ego's fear of God is at least logical, since the idea of Him does dispel the ego. 4 But fear of the</string>
                    <string>body, with which the ego identifies so closely, makes no sense at all.</string>

                    <string>the ego feels safe, since the body's vulnerability is its own best argument that you cannot be of God.</string>
                    <string>3 This is the belief that the ego sponsors eagerly. 4 Yet the ego hates the body, because it cannot</string>
                    <string>accept it as good enough to be its home. 5 Here is where the mind becomes actually dazed. 6 Being</string>
                    <string>told by the ego that it is really part of the body and that the body is its protector, the mind is also</string>
                    <string>told that the body cannot protect it. 7 Therefore, the mind asks, "Where can I go for protection?" to</string>
                    <string>which the ego replies, "Turn to me." 8 The mind, and not without cause, reminds the ego that it has</string>
                    <string>itself insisted that it is identified with the body, so there is no point in turning to it for protection. 9</string>
                    <string>The ego has no real answer to this because there is none, but it does have a typical solution. 10 It</string>
                    <string>obliterates the question from the mind's awareness. 11 Once out of awareness the question can and</string>
                    <string>does produce uneasiness, but it cannot be answered because it cannot be asked.</string>

                    <string>directed. 4 The goal must be formulated clearly and kept in mind. 5 Learning and wanting to learn</string>
                    <string>are inseparable. 6 You learn best when you believe what you are trying to learn is of value to you. 7</string>

                    <string>T-4.V.6. The ego thinks it is an advantage not to commit itself to anything that is eternal, because</string>
                    <string>the eternal must come from God. 2 Eternalness is the one function the ego has tried to develop, but</string>
                    <string>has systematically failed to achieve. 3 The ego compromises with the issue of the eternal, just as it</string>
                    <string>does with all issues touching on the real question in any way. 4 By becoming involved with</string>
                    <string>tangential issues, it hopes to hide the real question and keep it out of mind. 5 The ego's</string>
                    <string>characteristic busyness with nonessentials is for precisely that purpose. 6 Preoccupations with</string>
                    <string>problems set up to be incapable of solution are favorite ego devices for impeding learning progress.</string>
                    <string>7 In all these diversionary tactics, however, the one question that is never asked by those who pursue</string>
                    <string>them is, "What for?" 8 This is the question that you must learn to ask in connection with everything.</string>
                    <string>9 What is the purpose? 10 Whatever it is, it will direct your efforts automatically. 11 When you</string>
                    <string>make a decision of purpose, then, you have made a decision about your future effort; a decision that</string>
                    <string>will remain in effect unless you change your mind.</string>

                    <string>T-4.VI.1. The ego does not recognize the real source of "threat," and if you associate yourself with</string>
                    <string>the ego, you do not understand the situation as it is. 2 Only your allegiance to it gives the ego any</string>
                    <string>power over you. 3 I have spoken of the ego as if it were a separate thing, acting on its own. 4 This</string>
                    <string>was necessary to persuade you that you cannot dismiss it lightly, and must realize how much of your</string>
                    <string>thinking is ego-directed. 5 We cannot safely let it go at that, however, or you will regard yourself as</string>
                    <string>necessarily conflicted as long as you are here, or as long as you believe that you are here. 6 The ego</string>
                    <string>is nothing more than a part of your belief about yourself. 7 Your other life has continued without</string>
                    <string>interruption, and has been and always will be totally unaffected by your attempts to dissociate it.</string>

                    <string>never forget. 2 It is the same debt that you owe to me. 3 Whenever you act egotistically towards</string>
                    <string>another, you are throwing away the graciousness of your indebtedness and the holy perception it</string>
                    <string>would produce. 4 The term "holy" can be used here because, as you learn how much you are</string>
                    <string>indebted to the whole Sonship, which includes me, you come as close to knowledge as perception</string>
                    <string>can. 5 The gap is then so small that knowledge can easily flow across it and obliterate it forever.</string>

                    <string>often to me instead of to your ego for guidance. 2 The results will convince you increasingly that</string>
                    <string>this choice is the only sane one you can make. 3 No one who learns from experience that one choice</string>
                    <string>brings peace and joy while another brings chaos and disaster needs additional convincing. 4</string>
                    <string>Learning through rewards is more effective than learning through pain, because pain is an ego</string>
                    <string>illusion, and can never induce more than a temporary effect. 5 The rewards of God, however, are</string>
                    <string>immediately recognized as eternal. 6 Since this recognition is made by you and not the ego, the</string>
                    <string>recognition itself establishes that you and your ego cannot be identical. 7 You may believe that you</string>
                    <string>have already accepted this difference, but you are by no means convinced as yet. 8 The fact that you</string>
                    <string>believe you must escape from the ego shows this; but you cannot escape from the ego by humbling</string>
                    <string>it or controlling it or punishing it.</string>

                    <string>separation except by dissociating. 3 Having done this, it denies all truly natural impulses, not</string>
                    <string>because the ego is a separate thing, but because you want to believe that you are. 4 The ego is a</string>
                    <string>device for maintaining this belief, but it is still only your decision to use the device that enables it to</string>

                    <string>He must have thrown it away because he did not value it. 3 You can only show him how miserable</string>
                    <string>he is without it, and slowly bring it nearer so he can learn how his misery lessens as he approaches</string>
                    <string>it. 4 This teaches him to associate his misery with its absence, and the opposite of misery with its</string>
                    <string>presence. 5 It gradually becomes desirable as he changes his mind about its worth. 6 I am teaching</string>
                    <string>you to associate misery with the ego and joy with the spirit. 7 You have taught yourself the</string>
                    <string>opposite. 8 You are still free to choose, but can you really want the rewards of the ego in the</string>
                    <string>presence of the rewards of God?</string>

                    <string>way. 2 Your mission is very simple. 3 You are asked to live so as to demonstrate that you are not an</string>
                    <string>ego, and I do not choose God's channels wrongly. 4 The Holy One shares my trust, and accepts my</string>
                    <string>Atonement decisions because my will is never out of accord with His. 5 I have said before that I am</string>
                    <string>in charge of the Atonement. 6 This is only because I completed my part in it as a man, and can now</string>
                    <string>complete it through others. 7 My chosen channels cannot fail, because I will lend them my strength</string>

                    <string>gap. 2 Your gratitude to your brother is the only gift I want. 3 I will bring it to God for you,</string>
                    <string>knowing that to know your brother is to know God. 4 If you are grateful to your brother, you are</string>
                    <string>grateful to God for what He created. 5 Through your gratitude you come to know your brother, and</string>
                    <string>one moment of real recognition makes everyone your brother because each of them is of your</string>
                    <string>Father. 6 Love does not conquer all things, but it does set all things right. 7 Because you are the</string>
                    <string>Kingdom of God I can lead you back to your own creations. 8 You do not recognize them now, but</string>

                    <string>by those who disengage themselves from the Sonship, because they are disengaging themselves</string>

                    <string>correction is more helpful in a specific context. 2 Ego illusions are quite specific, although the mind</string>
                    <string>is naturally abstract. 3 Part of the mind becomes concrete, however, when it splits. 4 The concrete</string>
                    <string>part believes in the ego, because the ego depends on the concrete. 5 The ego is the part of the mind</string>
                    <string>that believes your existence is defined by separation.</string>

                    <string>T-4.VII.2. Everything the ego perceives is a separate whole, without the relationships that imply</string>
                    <string>being. 2 The ego is thus against communication, except insofar as it is utilized to establish</string>
                    <string>separateness rather than to abolish it. 3 The communication system of the ego is based on its own</string>
                    <string>thought system, as is everything else it dictates. 4 Its communication is controlled by its need to</string>
                    <string>protect itself, and it will disrupt communication when it experiences threat. 5 This disruption is a</string>
                    <string>reaction to a specific person or persons. 6 The specificity of the ego's thinking, then, results in</string>
                    <string>spurious generalization which is really not abstract at all. 7 It merely responds in certain specific</string>
                    <string>ways to everything it perceives as related.</string>

                    <string>T-4.VII.3. In contrast, spirit reacts in the same way to everything it knows is true, and does not</string>
                    <string>respond at all to anything else. 2 Nor does it make any attempt to establish what is true. 3 It knows</string>
                    <string>that what is true is everything that God created. 4 It is in complete and direct communication with</string>
                    <string>every aspect of creation, because it is in complete and direct communication with its Creator. 5 This</string>
                    <string>communication is the Will of God. 6 Creation and communication are synonymous. 7 God created</string>
                    <string>every mind by communicating His Mind to it, thus establishing it forever as a channel for the</string>
                    <string>reception of His Mind and Will. 8 Since only beings of a like order can truly communicate, His</string>
                    <string>creations naturally communicate with Him and like Him. 9 This communication is perfectly abstract,</string>
                    <string>since its quality is universal in application and not subject to any judgment, any exception or any</string>
                    <string>alteration. 10 God created you by this and for this. 11 The mind can distort its function, but it cannot</string>
                    <string>endow itself with functions it was not given. 12 That is why the mind cannot totally lose the ability</string>
                    <string>to communicate, even though it may refuse to utilize it on behalf of being.</string>

                    <string>how, what and with whom communication is judged to be worth undertaking. 3 Being is completely</string>
                    <string>without these distinctions. 4 It is a state in which the mind is in communication with everything that</string>
                    <string>is real. 5 To whatever extent you permit this state to be curtailed you are limiting your sense of your</string>
                    <string>own reality, which becomes total only by recognizing all reality in the glorious context of its real</string>

                    <string>is why God created you. 4 Divine Abstraction takes joy in sharing. 5 That is what creation means. 6</string>
                    <string>"How," "what" and "to whom" are irrelevant, because real creation gives everything, since it can</string>

                    <string>and its experience of His Son's experience. 7 The constant going out of His Love is blocked when</string>
                    <string>His channels are closed, and He is lonely when the minds He created do not communicate fully with</string>

                    <string>does want it brought to others. 4 This cannot be done with the actual revelation; its content cannot</string>
                    <string>be expressed, because it is intensely personal to the mind that receives it. 5 It can, however, be</string>

                    <string>refused to heal yourself. 4 The light that belongs to you is the light of joy. 5 Radiance is not</string>
                    <string>associated with sorrow. 6 Joy calls forth an integrated willingness to share it, and promotes the</string>
                    <string>mind's natural impulse to respond as one. 7 Those who attempt to heal without being wholly joyous</string>
                    <string>themselves call forth different kinds of responses at the same time, and thus deprive others of the</string>
                    <string>joy of responding wholeheartedly.</string>

                    <string>impossible to be wholly fearful and remain alive, the only possible whole state is that of love. 3</string>
                    <string>There is no difference between love and joy. 4 Therefore, the only possible whole state is the</string>
                    <string>wholly joyous. 5 To heal or to make joyous is therefore the same as to integrate and to make one. 6</string>
                    <string>That is why it makes no difference to what part or by what part of the Sonship the healing is</string>
                    <string>offered. 7 Every part benefits, and benefits equally.</string>

                    <string>You should want to bless them in return, out of gratitude. 3 You need not know them individually,</string>
                    <string>or they you. 4 The light is so strong that it radiates throughout the Sonship and returns thanks to the</string>
                    <string>Father for radiating His joy upon it. 5 Only God's holy children are worthy channels of His beautiful</string>
                    <string>joy, because only they are beautiful enough to hold it by sharing it. 6 It is impossible for a child of</string>
                    <string>God to love his neighbor except as himself. 7 That is why the healer's prayer is: 8 Let me know this</string>

                    <string>T-5.I.1. Healing is a thought by which two minds perceive their oneness and become glad. 2 This</string>
                    <string>gladness calls to every part of the Sonship to rejoice with them, and lets God go out into them and</string>
                    <string>through them. 3 Only the healed mind can experience revelation with lasting effect, because</string>
                    <string>revelation is an experience of pure joy. 4 If you do not choose to be wholly joyous, your mind</string>
                    <string>cannot have what it does not choose to be. 5 Remember that spirit knows no difference between</string>
                    <string>having and being. 6 The higher mind thinks according to the laws spirit obeys, and therefore honors</string>
                    <string>only the laws of God. 7 To spirit getting is meaningless and giving is all. 8 Having everything, spirit</string>
                    <string>holds everything by giving it, and thus creates as the Father created. 9 While this kind of thinking is</string>
                    <string>totally alien to having things, even to the lower mind it is quite comprehensible in connection with</string>
                    <string>ideas. 10 If you share a physical possession, you do divide its ownership. 11 If you share an idea,</string>
                    <string>however, you do not lessen it. 12 All of it is still yours although all of it has been given away. 13</string>
                    <string>Further, if the one to whom you give it accepts it as his, he reinforces it in your mind and thus</string>
                    <string>increases it. 14 If you can accept the concept that the world is one of ideas, the whole belief in the</string>
                    <string>false association the ego makes between giving and losing is gone.</string>

                    <string>increase by being given away. 3 The more who believe in them the stronger they become. 4</string>
                    <string>Everything is an idea. 5 How, then, can giving and losing be associated?</string>

                    <string>T-5.I.3. This is the invitation to the Holy Spirit. 2 I have said already that I can reach up and bring</string>
                    <string>the Holy Spirit down to you, but I can bring Him to you only at your own invitation. 3 The Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit is in your right mind, as He was in mine. 4 The Bible says, "May the mind be in you that was</string>
                    <string>also in Christ Jesus," and uses this as a blessing. 5 It is the blessing of miracle-mindedness. 6 It asks</string>
                    <string>that you may think as I thought, joining with me in Christ thinking.</string>

                    <string>T-5.I.4. The Holy Spirit is the only part of the Holy Trinity that has a symbolic function. 2 He is</string>
                    <string>referred to as the Healer, the Comforter and the Guide. 3 He is also described as something</string>
                    <string>"separate," apart from the Father and from the Son. 4 I myself said, "If I go I will send you another</string>
                    <string>Comforter and he will abide with you." 5 His symbolic function makes the Holy Spirit difficult to</string>
                    <string>understand, because symbolism is open to different interpretations. 6 As a man and also one of</string>
                    <string>God's creations, my right thinking, which came from the Holy Spirit or the Universal Inspiration,</string>
                    <string>taught me first and foremost that this Inspiration is for all. 7 I could not have It myself without</string>
                    <string>knowing this. 8 The word "know" is proper in this context, because the Holy Spirit is so close to</string>
                    <string>knowledge that He calls it forth; or better, allows it to come. 9 I have spoken before of the higher or</string>
                    <string>"true" perception, which is so near to truth that God Himself can flow across the little gap. 10</string>
                    <string>Knowledge is always ready to flow everywhere, but it cannot oppose. 11 Therefore you can obstruct</string>
                    <string>it, although you can never lose it.</string>

                    <string>T-5.I.5. The Holy Spirit is the Christ Mind which is aware of the knowledge that lies beyond</string>
                    <string>perception. 2 He came into being with the separation as a protection, inspiring the Atonement</string>
                    <string>principle at the same time. 3 Before that there was no need for healing, for no one was comfortless.</string>
                    <string>4 The Voice of the Holy Spirit is the Call to Atonement, or the restoration of the integrity of the</string>
                    <string>mind. 5 When the Atonement is complete and the whole Sonship is healed there will be no Call to</string>
                    <string>return. 6 But what God creates is eternal. 7 The Holy Spirit will remain with the Sons of God, to</string>
                    <string>bless their creations and keep them in the light of joy.</string>

                    <string>T-5.I.6. God honored even the miscreations of His children because they had made them. 2 But He</string>
                    <string>also blessed His children with a way of thinking that could raise their perceptions so high they</string>
                    <string>could reach almost back to Him. 3 The Holy Spirit is the Mind of the Atonement. 4 He represents a</string>
                    <string>state of mind close enough to One-mindedness that transfer to it is at last possible. 5 Perception is</string>
                    <string>not knowledge, but it can be transferred to knowledge, or cross over into it. 6 It might even be more</string>
                    <string>helpful here to use the literal meaning of transferred or "carried over," since the last step is taken by</string>
                    <string>God.</string>

                    <string>T-5.I.7. The Holy Spirit, the shared Inspiration of all the Sonship, induces a kind of perception in</string>
                    <string>which many elements are like those in the Kingdom of Heaven itself: 2 First, its universality is</string>
                    <string>perfectly clear, and no one who attains it could believe for one instant that sharing it involves</string>
                    <string>anything but gain. 3 Second, it is incapable of attack and is therefore truly open. 4 This means that</string>
                    <string>although it does not engender knowledge, it does not obstruct it in any way. 5 Finally, it points the</string>
                    <string>way beyond the healing that it brings, and leads the mind beyond its own integration toward the</string>
                    <string>paths of creation. 6 It is at this point that sufficient quantitative change occurs to produce a real</string>
                    <string>qualitative shift.</string>

                    <string>T-5.II.1. Healing is not creating; it is reparation. 2 The Holy Spirit promotes healing by looking</string>
                    <string>beyond it to what the children of God were before healing was needed, and will be when they have</string>
                    <string>been healed. 3 This alteration of the time sequence should be quite familiar, because it is very</string>
                    <string>similar to the shift in the perception of time that the miracle introduces. 4 The Holy Spirit is the</string>
                    <string>motivation for miracle-mindedness; the decision to heal the separation by letting it go. 5 Your will is</string>
                    <string>still in you because God placed it in your mind, and although you can keep it asleep you cannot</string>
                    <string>obliterate it. 6 God Himself keeps your will alive by transmitting it from His Mind to yours as long</string>
                    <string>as there is time. 7 The miracle itself is a reflection of this union of Will between Father and Son.</string>

                    <string>T-5.II.2. The Holy Spirit is the spirit of joy. 2 He is the Call to return with which God blessed the</string>
                    <string>minds of His separated Sons. 3 This is the vocation of the mind. 4 The mind had no calling until the</string>
                    <string>separation, because before that it had only being, and would not have understood the Call to right</string>
                    <string>thinking. 5 The Holy Spirit is God's Answer to the separation; the means by which the Atonement</string>
                    <string>heals until the whole mind returns to creating.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                    <string>T-5.II.3. The principle of Atonement and the separation began at the same time. 2 When the ego</string>
                    <string>was made, God placed in the mind the Call to joy. 3 This Call is so strong that the ego always</string>
                    <string>dissolves at Its sound. 4 That is why you must choose to hear one of two voices within you. 5 One</string>
                    <string>you made yourself, and that one is not of God. 6 But the other is given you by God, Who asks you</string>
                    <string>only to listen to it. 7 The Holy Spirit is in you in a very literal sense. 8 His is the Voice that calls</string>
                    <string>you back to where you were before and will be again. 9 It is possible even in this world to hear only</string>
                    <string>that Voice and no other. 10 It takes effort and great willingness to learn. 11 It is the final lesson that</string>
                    <string>I learned, and God's Sons are as equal as learners as they are as Sons.</string>

                    <string>and so you need a new light. 2 The Holy Spirit is the radiance that you must let banish the idea of</string>
                    <string>darkness. 3 His is the glory before which dissociation falls away, and the Kingdom of Heaven</string>
                    <string>breaks through into its own. 4 Before the separation you did not need guidance. 5 You knew as you</string>

                    <string>evaluative, because it implies there is a right way and also a wrong way, one to be chosen and the</string>
                    <string>other to be avoided. 3 By choosing one you give up the other. 4 The choice for the Holy Spirit is the</string>
                    <string>choice for God. 5 God is not in you in a literal sense; you are part of Him. 6 When you chose to</string>
                    <string>leave Him He gave you a Voice to speak for Him because He could no longer share His knowledge</string>
                    <string>with you without hindrance. 7 Direct communication was broken because you had made another</string>

                    <string>T-5.II.6. The Holy Spirit calls you both to remember and to forget. 2 You have chosen to be in a</string>
                    <string>state of opposition in which opposites are possible. 3 As a result, there are choices you must make. 4</string>
                    <string>In the holy state the will is free, so that its creative power is unlimited and choice is meaningless. 5</string>
                    <string>Freedom to choose is the same power as freedom to create, but its application is different. 6</string>
                    <string>Choosing depends on a split mind. 7 The Holy Spirit is one way of choosing. 8 God did not leave</string>
                    <string>His children comfortless, even though they chose to leave Him. 9 The voice they put in their minds</string>
                    <string>was not the Voice for His Will, for which the Holy Spirit speaks.</string>

                    <string>T-5.II.7. The Voice of the Holy Spirit does not command, because It is incapable of arrogance. 2 It</string>
                    <string>does not demand, because It does not seek control. 3 It does not overcome, because It does not</string>
                    <string>attack. 4 It merely reminds. 5 It is compelling only because of what It reminds you of. 6 It brings to</string>
                    <string>your mind the other way, remaining quiet even in the midst of the turmoil you may make. 7 The</string>
                    <string>Voice for God is always quiet, because It speaks of peace. 8 Peace is stronger than war because it</string>
                    <string>heals. 9 War is division, not increase. 10 No one gains from strife. 11 What profiteth it a man if he</string>
                    <string>gain the whole world and lose his own soul? 12 If you listen to the wrong voice you have lost sight</string>
                    <string>of your soul. 13 You cannot lose it, but you can not know it. 14 It is therefore "lost" to you until you</string>

                    <string>speaks for the right choice, because He speaks for God. 3 He is your remaining communication with</string>
                    <string>God, which you can interrupt but cannot destroy. 4 The Holy Spirit is the way in which God's Will</string>
                    <string>is done on earth as it is in Heaven. 5 Both Heaven and earth are in you, because the call of both is in</string>

                    <string>decision that gave me all power in Heaven and earth. 3 My only gift to you is to help you make the</string>
                    <string>same decision. 4 This decision is the choice to share it, because the decision itself is the decision to</string>
                    <string>share. 5 It is made by giving, and is therefore the one choice that resembles true creation. 6 I am</string>
                    <string>your model for decision. 7 By deciding for God I showed you that this decision can be made, and</string>

                    <string>sleeping but from waking. 5 The Holy Spirit is the Call to awaken and be glad. 6 The world is very</string>
                    <string>tired, because it is the idea of weariness. 7 Our task is the joyous one of waking it to the Call for</string>
                    <string>God. 8 Everyone will answer the Call of the Holy Spirit, or the Sonship cannot be as One. 9 What</string>

                    <string>already said that the Holy Spirit is the Bridge for the transfer of perception to knowledge, so we can</string>
                    <string>use the terms as if they were related, because in His Mind they are. 3 This relationship must be in</string>
                    <string>His Mind because, unless it were, the separation between the two ways of thinking would not be</string>
                    <string>open to healing. 4 He is part of the Holy Trinity, because His Mind is partly yours and also partly</string>
                    <string>God's. 5 This needs clarification, not in statement but in experience.</string>

                    <string>Being the Call for God, it is also the idea of God. 4 Since you are part of God it is also the idea of</string>
                    <string>yourself, as well as of all His creations. 5 The idea of the Holy Spirit shares the property of other</string>
                    <string>ideas because it follows the laws of the universe of which it is a part. 6 It is strengthened by being</string>
                    <string>given away. 7 It increases in you as you give it to your brother. 8 Your brother does not have to be</string>
                    <string>aware of the Holy Spirit in himself or in you for this miracle to occur. 9 He may have dissociated</string>
                    <string>the Call for God, just as you have. 10 This dissociation is healed in both of you as you become</string>
                    <string>aware of the Call for God in him, and thus acknowledge Its being.</string>

                    <string>him. 4 See him through the Holy Spirit in his mind, and you will recognize Him in yours. 5 What</string>
                    <string>you acknowledge in your brother you are acknowledging in yourself, and what you share you</string>

                    <string>increased in strength before you can hear It. 4 It is impossible to hear It in yourself while It is so</string>
                    <string>weak in your mind. 5 It is not weak in Itself, but It is limited by your unwillingness to hear It. 6 If</string>
                    <string>you make the mistake of looking for the Holy Spirit in yourself alone your thoughts will frighten</string>
                    <string>you because, by adopting the ego's viewpoint, you are undertaking an ego-alien journey with the</string>

                    <string>eternity. 3 I have said before that the Holy Spirit is God's Answer to the ego. 4 Everything of which</string>
                    <string>the Holy Spirit reminds you is in direct opposition to the ego's notions, because true and false</string>
                    <string>perceptions are themselves opposed. 5 The Holy Spirit has the task of undoing what the ego has</string>
                    <string>made. 6 He undoes it at the same level on which the ego operates, or the mind would be unable to</string>

                    <string>2 So it is with the ego and the Holy Spirit; with time and eternity. 3 Eternity is an idea of God, so</string>
                    <string>the Holy Spirit understands it perfectly. 4 Time is a belief of the ego, so the lower mind, which is</string>
                    <string>the ego's domain, accepts it without question. 5 The only aspect of time that is eternal is now.</string>

                    <string>of the spirit. 2 His ability to deal with symbols enables Him to work with the ego's beliefs in its own</string>
                    <string>language. 3 His ability to look beyond symbols into eternity enables Him to understand the laws of</string>
                    <string>God, for which He speaks. 4 He can therefore perform the function of reinterpreting what the ego</string>
                    <string>makes, not by destruction but by understanding. 5 Understanding is light, and light leads to</string>
                    <string>knowledge. 6 The Holy Spirit is in light because He is in you who are light, but you yourself do not</string>
                    <string>know this. 7 It is therefore the task of the Holy Spirit to reinterpret you on behalf of God.</string>

                    <string>T-5.III.8. You cannot understand yourself alone. 2 This is because you have no meaning apart from</string>
                    <string>your rightful place in the Sonship, and the rightful place of the Sonship is God. 3 This is your life,</string>
                    <string>your eternity and your Self. 4 It is of this that the Holy Spirit reminds you. 5 It is this that the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit sees. 6 This vision frightens the ego because it is so calm. 7 Peace is the ego's greatest enemy</string>
                    <string>because, according to its interpretation of reality, war is the guarantee of its survival. 8 The ego</string>
                    <string>becomes strong in strife. 9 If you believe there is strife you will react viciously, because the idea of</string>
                    <string>danger has entered your mind. 10 The idea itself is an appeal to the ego. 11 The Holy Spirit is as</string>
                    <string>vigilant as the ego to the call of danger, opposing it with His strength just as the ego welcomes it.</string>
                    <string>12 The Holy Spirit counters this welcome by welcoming peace. 13 Eternity and peace are as closely</string>
                    <string>related as are time and war.</string>

                    <string>your beliefs. 3 The separation is merely another term for a split mind. 4 The ego is the symbol of</string>
                    <string>separation, just as the Holy Spirit is the symbol of peace. 5 What you perceive in others you are</string>
                    <string>strengthening in yourself. 6 You may let your mind misperceive, but the Holy Spirit lets your mind</string>
                    <string>reinterpret its own misperceptions.</string>

                    <string>understands to teach you that you do not understand it. 3 The Holy Spirit can deal with a reluctant</string>
                    <string>learner without going counter to his mind, because part of it is still for God. 4 Despite the ego's</string>
                    <string>attempts to conceal this part, it is still much stronger than the ego, although the ego does not</string>
                    <string>recognize it. 5 The Holy Spirit recognizes it perfectly because it is His Own dwelling place; the</string>
                    <string>place in the mind where He is at home. 6 You are at home there, too, because it is a place of peace,</string>
                    <string>and peace is of God. 7 You who are part of God are not at home except in His peace. 8 If peace is</string>

                    <string>the ego made, sees the world as a teaching device for bringing you home. 2 The Holy Spirit must</string>
                    <string>perceive time, and reinterpret it into the timeless. 3 He must work through opposites, because He</string>
                    <string>must work with and for a mind that is in opposition. 4 Correct and learn, and be open to learning. 5</string>
                    <string>You have not made truth, but truth can still set you free. 6 Look as the Holy Spirit looks, and</string>

                    <string>is in communion with God always, and He is part of you. 9 He is your Guide to salvation, because</string>

                    <string>The Holy Spirit will help you reinterpret everything that you perceive as fearful, and teach you that</string>
                    <string>only what is loving is true. 4 Truth is beyond your ability to destroy, but entirely within your ability</string>
                    <string>to accept. 5 It belongs to you because, as an extension of God, you created it with Him. 6 It is yours</string>
                    <string>because it is part of you, just as you are part of God because He created you. 7 Nothing that is good</string>
                    <string>can be lost because it comes from the Holy Spirit, the Voice for creation. 8 Nothing that is not good</string>
                    <string>was ever created, and therefore cannot be protected. 9 The Atonement is the guarantee of the safety</string>
                    <string>of the Kingdom, and the union of the Sonship is its protection. 10 The ego cannot prevail against</string>
                    <string>the Kingdom because the Sonship is united. 11 In the presence of those who hear the Holy Spirit's</string>
                    <string>Call to be as one, the ego fades away and is undone.</string>

                    <string>unshared. 3 It does not die; it was merely never born. 4 Physical birth is not a beginning; it is a</string>
                    <string>continuing. 5 Everything that continues has already been born. 6 It will increase as you are willing</string>
                    <string>to return the unhealed part of your mind to the higher part, returning it undivided to creation. 7 I</string>
                    <string>have come to give you the foundation, so your own thoughts can make you really free. 8 You have</string>
                    <string>carried the burden of unshared ideas that are too weak to increase, but having made them you did</string>
                    <string>not realize how to undo them. 9 You cannot cancel out your past errors alone. 10 They will not</string>
                    <string>disappear from your mind without the Atonement, a remedy not of your making. 11 The Atonement</string>
                    <string>must be understood as a pure act of sharing. 12 That is what I meant when I said it is possible even</string>
                    <string>in this world to listen to one Voice. 13 If you are part of God and the Sonship is One, you cannot be</string>

                    <string>exile from the Kingdom, but in the Kingdom itself it has no power. 5 Ideas of the spirit do not leave</string>
                    <string>the mind that thinks them, nor can they conflict with each other. 6 However, ideas of the ego can</string>
                    <string>conflict because they occur at different levels and also include opposite thoughts at the same level. 7</string>
                    <string>It is impossible to share opposing thoughts. 8 You can share only the thoughts that are of God and</string>
                    <string>that He keeps for you. 9 And of such is the Kingdom of Heaven. 10 The rest remains with you until</string>
                    <string>the Holy Spirit has reinterpreted them in the light of the Kingdom, making them, too, worthy of</string>
                    <string>being shared. 11 When they have been sufficiently purified He lets you give them away. 12 The</string>
                    <string>decision to share them is their purification.</string>

                    <string>yourself and God if you forsake any of your brothers. 7 You must learn to see them as they are, and</string>

                    <string>ego's use of guilt is clarified. 2 The ego has a purpose, just as the Holy Spirit has. 3 The ego's</string>
                    <string>purpose is fear, because only the fearful can be egotistic. 4 The ego's logic is as impeccable as that</string>
                    <string>of the Holy Spirit, because your mind has the means at its disposal to side with Heaven or earth, as</string>
                    <string>it elects. 5 But again, remember that both are in you.</string>

                    <string>T-5.V.2. In Heaven there is no guilt, because the Kingdom is attained through the Atonement, which</string>
                    <string>releases you to create. 2 The word "create" is appropriate here because, once what you have made is</string>
                    <string>undone by the Holy Spirit, the blessed residue is restored and therefore continues in creation. 3</string>
                    <string>What is truly blessed is incapable of giving rise to guilt, and must give rise to joy. 4 This makes it</string>
                    <string>invulnerable to the ego because its peace is unassailable. 5 It is invulnerable to disruption because it</string>
                    <string>is whole. 6 Guilt is always disruptive. 7 Anything that engenders fear is divisive because it obeys the</string>
                    <string>law of division. 8 If the ego is the symbol of the separation, it is also the symbol of guilt. 9 Guilt is</string>
                    <string>more than merely not of God. 10 It is the symbol of attack on God. 11 This is a totally meaningless</string>
                    <string>concept except to the ego, but do not underestimate the power of the ego's belief in it. 12 This is the</string>
                    <string>belief from which all guilt really stems.</string>

                    <string>T-5.V.3. The ego is the part of the mind that believes in division. 2 How could part of God detach</string>
                    <string>itself without believing it is attacking Him? 3 We spoke before of the authority problem as based on</string>
                    <string>the concept of usurping God's power. 4 The ego believes that this is what you did because it believes</string>
                    <string>that it is you. 5 If you identify with the ego, you must perceive yourself as guilty. 6 Whenever you</string>
                    <string>respond to your ego you will experience guilt, and you will fear punishment. 7 The ego is quite</string>
                    <string>literally a fearful thought. 8 However ridiculous the idea of attacking God may be to the sane mind,</string>
                    <string>never forget that the ego is not sane. 9 It represents a delusional system, and speaks for it. 10</string>
                    <string>Listening to the ego's voice means that you believe it is possible to attack God, and that a part of</string>
                    <string>Him has been torn away by you. 11 Fear of retaliation from without follows, because the severity of</string>
                    <string>the guilt is so acute that it must be projected.</string>

                    <string>T-5.V.4. Whatever you accept into your mind has reality for you. 2 It is your acceptance of it that</string>
                    <string>makes it real. 3 If you enthrone the ego in your mind, your allowing it to enter makes it your reality.</string>
                    <string>4 This is because the mind is capable of creating reality or making illusions. 5 I said before that you</string>
                    <string>must learn to think with God. 6 To think with Him is to think like Him. 7 This engenders joy, not</string>
                    <string>guilt, because it is natural. 8 Guilt is a sure sign that your thinking is unnatural. 9 Unnatural thinking</string>
                    <string>will always be attended with guilt, because it is the belief in sin. 10 The ego does not perceive sin as</string>
                    <string>a lack of love, but as a positive act of assault. 11 This is necessary to the ego's survival because, as</string>
                    <string>soon as you regard sin as a lack, you will automatically attempt to remedy the situation. 12 And you</string>
                    <string>will succeed. 13 The ego regards this as doom, but you must learn to regard it as freedom.</string>

                    <string>healed. 3 The sane mind cannot conceive of illness because it cannot conceive of attacking anyone</string>
                    <string>or anything. 4 I said before that illness is a form of magic. 5 It might be better to say that it is a</string>
                    <string>form of magical solution. 6 The ego believes that by punishing itself it will mitigate the punishment</string>
                    <string>of God. 7 Yet even in this it is arrogant. 8 It attributes to God a punishing intent, and then takes this</string>
                    <string>intent as its own prerogative. 9 It tries to usurp all the functions of God as it perceives them, because</string>
                    <string>it recognizes that only total allegiance can be trusted.</string>

                    <string>according to what it wants, just as you can. 2 That is why the question, "What do you want?" must</string>
                    <string>be answered. 3 You are answering it every minute and every second, and each moment of decision</string>
                    <string>is a judgment that is anything but ineffectual. 4 Its effects will follow automatically until the</string>
                    <string>decision is changed. 5 Remember, though, that the alternatives themselves are unalterable. 6 The</string>
                    <string>Holy Spirit, like the ego, is a decision. 7 Together they constitute all the alternatives the mind can</string>
                    <string>accept and obey. 8 The Holy Spirit and the ego are the only choices open to you. 9 God created one,</string>
                    <string>and so you cannot eradicate it. 10 You made the other, and so you can. 11 Only what God creates is</string>
                    <string>irreversible and unchangeable. 12 What you made can always be changed because, when you do not</string>
                    <string>think like God, you are not really thinking at all. 13 Delusional ideas are not real thoughts, although</string>
                    <string>you can believe in them. 14 But you are wrong. 15 The function of thought comes from God and is</string>
                    <string>in God. 16 As part of His Thought, you cannot think apart from Him.</string>

                    <string>T-5.V.7. Irrational thought is disordered thought. 2 God Himself orders your thought because your</string>
                    <string>thought was created by Him. 3 Guilt feelings are always a sign that you do not know this. 4 They</string>
                    <string>also show that you believe you can think apart from God, and want to. 5 Every disordered thought is</string>
                    <string>attended by guilt at its inception, and maintained by guilt in its continuance. 6 Guilt is inescapable</string>
                    <string>by those who believe they order their own thoughts, and must therefore obey their dictates. 7 This</string>
                    <string>makes them feel responsible for their errors without recognizing that, by accepting this</string>
                    <string>responsibility, they are reacting irresponsibly. 8 If the sole responsibility of the miracle worker is to</string>
                    <string>accept the Atonement for himself, and I assure you that it is, then the responsibility for what is</string>
                    <string>atoned for cannot be yours. 9 The dilemma cannot be resolved except by accepting the solution of</string>
                    <string>undoing. 10 You would be responsible for the effects of all your wrong thinking if it could not be</string>
                    <string>undone. 11 The purpose of the Atonement is to save the past in purified form only. 12 If you accept</string>
                    <string>the remedy for disordered thought, a remedy whose efficacy is beyond doubt, how can its symptoms</string>

                    <string>cannot be lost. 2 The Mind that was in me is in you, for God creates with perfect fairness. 3 Let the</string>
                    <string>Holy Spirit remind you always of His fairness, and let me teach you how to share it with your</string>
                    <string>brothers. 4 How else can the chance to claim it for yourself be given you? 5 The two voices speak</string>
                    <string>for different interpretations of the same thing simultaneously; or almost simultaneously, for the ego</string>

                    <string>always wrong, because they are based on the error they were made to uphold. 3 Nothing the ego</string>
                    <string>perceives is interpreted correctly. 4 Not only does the ego cite Scripture for its purpose, but it even</string>
                    <string>interprets Scripture as a witness for itself. 5 The Bible is a fearful thing in the ego's judgment. 6</string>
                    <string>Perceiving it as frightening, it interprets it fearfully. 7 Being afraid, you do not appeal to the Higher</string>

                    <string>3 To the Holy Spirit, the statement means that in later generations He can still reinterpret what</string>

                    <string>because it is part of your thought, but because it is uncreative and therefore unsharing, it will be</string>
                    <string>reinterpreted to release you from fear. 5 The part of your mind that you have given to the ego will</string>

                    <string>also knows that time is meaningless. 6 He reminds you of this in every passing moment of time,</string>
                    <string>because it is His special function to return you to eternity and remain to bless your creations there. 7</string>
                    <string>He is the only blessing you can truly give, because He is truly blessed. 8 Because He has been given</string>

                    <string>T-6.I.3. You have probably reacted for years as if you were being crucified. 2 This is a marked</string>
                    <string>tendency of the separated, who always refuse to consider what they have done to themselves. 3</string>
                    <string>Projection means anger, anger fosters assault, and assault promotes fear. 4 The real meaning of the</string>
                    <string>crucifixion lies in the apparent intensity of the assault of some of the Sons of God upon another. 5</string>
                    <string>This, of course, is impossible, and must be fully understood as impossible. 6 Otherwise, I cannot</string>
                    <string>serve as a model for learning.</string>

                    <string>T-6.I.4. Assault can ultimately be made only on the body. 2 There is little doubt that one body can</string>
                    <string>assault another, and can even destroy it. 3 Yet if destruction itself is impossible, anything that is</string>
                    <string>destructible cannot be real. 4 Its destruction, therefore, does not justify anger. 5 To the extent to</string>
                    <string>which you believe that it does, you are accepting false premises and teaching them to others. 6 The</string>
                    <string>message the crucifixion was intended to teach was that it is not necessary to perceive any form of</string>
                    <string>assault in persecution, because you cannot be persecuted. 7 If you respond with anger, you must be</string>
                    <string>equating yourself with the destructible, and are therefore regarding yourself insanely.</string>

                    <string>equality can be demonstrated only through joint decision. 2 You are free to perceive yourself as</string>
                    <string>persecuted if you choose. 3 When you do choose to react that way, however, you might remember</string>
                    <string>that I was persecuted as the world judges, and did not share this evaluation for myself. 4 And</string>
                    <string>because I did not share it, I did not strengthen it. 5 I therefore offered a different interpretation of</string>
                    <string>attack, and one which I want to share with you. 6 If you will believe it, you will help me teach it.</string>

                    <string>persecuted, you are teaching persecution. 3 This is not a lesson a Son of God should want to teach if</string>
                    <string>he is to realize his own salvation. 4 Rather, teach your own perfect immunity, which is the truth in</string>
                    <string>you, and realize that it cannot be assailed. 5 Do not try to protect it yourself, or you are believing</string>
                    <string>that it is assailable. 6 You are not asked to be crucified, which was part of my own teaching</string>
                    <string>contribution. 7 You are merely asked to follow my example in the face of much less extreme</string>
                    <string>temptations to misperceive, and not to accept them as false justifications for anger. 8 There can be</string>
                    <string>no justification for the unjustifiable. 9 Do not believe there is, and do not teach that there is. 10</string>
                    <string>Remember always that what you believe you will teach. 11 Believe with me, and we will become</string>

                    <string>merely the dawning on your mind of what is already in it. 3 God placed it there Himself, and so it is</string>
                    <string>true forever. 4 I believed in it, and therefore accepted it as true for me. 5 Help me to teach it to our</string>

                    <string>weakens them as teachers and as learners. 2 Yet I know they cannot really betray themselves or me,</string>
                    <string>and that it is still on them that I must build my church. 3 There is no choice in this, because only</string>
                    <string>you can be the foundation of God's church. 4 A church is where an altar is, and the presence of the</string>
                    <string>altar is what makes the church holy. 5 A church that does not inspire love has a hidden altar that is</string>
                    <string>not serving the purpose for which God intended it. 6 I must found His church on you, because those</string>
                    <string>who accept me as a model are literally my disciples. 7 Disciples are followers, and if the model they</string>
                    <string>follow has chosen to save them pain in all respects, they are unwise not to follow him.</string>

                    <string>judged by the ego, does not matter. 2 As the world judges these things, but not as God knows them,</string>
                    <string>I was betrayed, abandoned, beaten, torn, and finally killed. 3 It was clear that this was only because</string>

                    <string>purpose, and that is the only way in which I can be perceived as the way, the truth and the life. 4</string>
                    <string>When you hear only one Voice you are never called on to sacrifice. 5 On the contrary, by being able</string>
                    <string>to hear the Holy Spirit in others you can learn from their experiences, and can gain from them</string>
                    <string>without experiencing them directly yourself. 6 That is because the Holy Spirit is One, and anyone</string>
                    <string>who listens is inevitably led to demonstrate His way for all.</string>

                    <string>the Holy Spirit, Whom we share, makes this unnecessary. 3 To use my experiences constructively,</string>
                    <string>however, you must still follow my example in how to perceive them. 4 My brothers and yours are</string>
                    <string>constantly engaged in justifying the unjustifiable. 5 My one lesson, which I must teach as I learned</string>
                    <string>it, is that no perception that is out of accord with the judgment of the Holy Spirit can be justified. 6 I</string>
                    <string>undertook to show this was true in an extreme case, merely because it would serve as a good</string>

                    <string>rather than as the call for peace for which it was intended. 2 The Apostles often misunderstood it,</string>
                    <string>and for the same reason that anyone misunderstands it. 3 Their own imperfect love made them</string>
                    <string>vulnerable to projection, and out of their own fear they spoke of the "wrath of God" as His</string>
                    <string>retaliatory weapon. 4 Nor could they speak of the crucifixion entirely without anger, because their</string>
                    <string>sense of guilt had made them angry.</string>

                    <string>T-6.I.15. These are some of the examples of upside-down thinking in the New Testament, although</string>
                    <string>its gospel is really only the message of love. 2 If the Apostles had not felt guilty, they never could</string>
                    <string>have quoted me as saying, "I come not to bring peace but a sword." 3 This is clearly the opposite of</string>
                    <string>everything I taught. 4 Nor could they have described my reactions to Judas as they did, if they had</string>
                    <string>really understood me. 5 I could not have said, "Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?" unless I</string>
                    <string>believed in betrayal. 6 The whole message of the crucifixion was simply that I did not. 7 The</string>
                    <string>"punishment" I was said to have called forth upon Judas was a similar mistake. 8 Judas was my</string>
                    <string>brother and a Son of God, as much a part of the Sonship as myself. 9 Was it likely that I would</string>
                    <string>condemn him when I was ready to demonstrate that condemnation is impossible?</string>

                    <string>much they would understand later, because they were not wholly ready to follow me at the time. 2 I</string>
                    <string>do not want you to allow any fear to enter into the thought system toward which I am guiding you. 3</string>
                    <string>I do not call for martyrs but for teachers. 4 No one is punished for sins, and the Sons of God are not</string>
                    <string>sinners. 5 Any concept of punishment involves the projection of blame, and reinforces the idea that</string>
                    <string>blame is justified. 6 The result is a lesson in blame, for all behavior teaches the beliefs that motivate</string>
                    <string>it. 7 The crucifixion was the result of clearly opposed thought systems; the perfect symbol of the</string>
                    <string>"conflict" between the ego and the Son of God. 8 This conflict seems just as real now, and its</string>

                    <string>He recognizes it in others, thus strengthening it in both. 3 Instead of anger this arouses love for</string>
                    <string>both, because it establishes inclusion. 4 Perceiving equality, the Holy Spirit perceives equal needs. 5</string>
                    <string>This invites Atonement automatically, because Atonement is the one need in this world that is</string>
                    <string>universal. 6 To perceive yourself this way is the only way in which you can find happiness in the</string>

                    <string>everything for good, but He does not believe in what is not true. 3 Since the Holy Spirit is in your</string>
                    <string>mind, your mind can also believe only what is true. 4 The Holy Spirit can speak only for this,</string>
                    <string>because He speaks for God. 5 He tells you to return your whole mind to God, because it has never</string>
                    <string>left Him. 6 If it has never left Him, you need only perceive it as it is to be returned. 7 The full</string>
                    <string>awareness of the Atonement, then, is the recognition that the separation never occurred. 8 The ego</string>
                    <string>cannot prevail against this because it is an explicit statement that the ego never occurred.</string>

                    <string>T-6.II.11. The ego can accept the idea that return is necessary because it can so easily make the idea</string>
                    <string>seem difficult. 2 Yet the Holy Spirit tells you that even return is unnecessary, because what never</string>
                    <string>happened cannot be difficult. 3 However, you can make the idea of return both necessary and</string>
                    <string>difficult. 4 Yet it is surely clear that the perfect need nothing, and you cannot experience perfection</string>
                    <string>as a difficult accomplishment, because that is what you are. 5 This is the way in which you must</string>
                    <string>perceive God's creations, bringing all of your perceptions into the one line the Holy Spirit sees. 6</string>
                    <string>This line is the direct line of communication with God, and lets your mind converge with His. 7</string>
                    <string>There is no conflict anywhere in this perception, because it means that all perception is guided by</string>
                    <string>the Holy Spirit, Whose Mind is fixed on God. 8 Only the Holy Spirit can resolve conflict, because</string>
                    <string>only the Holy Spirit is conflict-free. 9 He perceives only what is true in your mind, and extends</string>

                    <string>2 The ego projects to exclude, and therefore to deceive. 3 The Holy Spirit extends by recognizing</string>
                    <string>Himself in every mind, and thus perceives them as one. 4 Nothing conflicts in this perception,</string>
                    <string>because what the Holy Spirit perceives is all the same. 5 Wherever He looks He sees Himself, and</string>
                    <string>because He is united He offers the whole Kingdom always. 6 This is the one message God gave to</string>
                    <string>Him and for which He must speak, because that is what He is. 7 The peace of God lies in that</string>
                    <string>message, and so the peace of God lies in you. 8 The great peace of the Kingdom shines in your</string>

                    <string>T-6.III.1. As we have already emphasized, every idea begins in the mind of the thinker. 2 Therefore,</string>
                    <string>what extends from the mind is still in it, and from what it extends it knows itself. 3 The word</string>
                    <string>"knows" is correct here, because the Holy Spirit still holds knowledge safe in your mind through His</string>
                    <string>impartial perception. 4 By attacking nothing, He presents no barrier to the communication of God. 5</string>
                    <string>Therefore, being is never threatened. 6 Your Godlike mind can never be defiled. 7 The ego never</string>
                    <string>was and never will be part of it, but through the ego you can hear and teach and learn what is not</string>
                    <string>true. 8 You have taught yourself to believe that you are not what you are. 9 You cannot teach what</string>
                    <string>you have not learned, and what you teach you strengthen in yourself because you are sharing it. 10</string>

                    <string>deny this, you make what you are something you must learn to remember. 4 I said before that the</string>
                    <string>message of the crucifixion was, "Teach only love, for that is what you are." 5 This is the one lesson</string>
                    <string>that is perfectly unified, because it is the only lesson that is one. 6 Only by teaching it can you learn</string>
                    <string>it. 7 "As you teach so will you learn." 8 If that is true, and it is true indeed, do not forget that what</string>
                    <string>you teach is teaching you. 9 And what you project or extend you believe.</string>

                    <string>others your own mind perceives itself as totally harmless. 2 Once it can accept this fully, it sees no</string>
                    <string>need to protect itself. 3 The protection of God then dawns upon it, assuring it that it is perfectly safe</string>
                    <string>forever. 4 The perfectly safe are wholly benign. 5 They bless because they know that they are</string>
                    <string>blessed. 6 Without anxiety the mind is wholly kind, and because it extends beneficence it is</string>
                    <string>beneficent. 7 Safety is the complete relinquishment of attack. 8 No compromise is possible in this. 9</string>
                    <string>Teach attack in any form and you have learned it, and it will hurt you. 10 Yet this learning is not</string>

                    <string>Holy Spirit will be glad when He has brought you home and you no longer need His guidance. 6</string>
                    <string>The ego does not regard itself as part of you. 7 Herein lies its primary error, the foundation of its</string>

                    <string>not remain within the Kingdom without love, and since the Kingdom is love, you believe that you</string>
                    <string>are without it. 5 This enables the ego to regard itself as separate and outside its maker, thus speaking</string>
                    <string>for the part of your mind that believes you are separate and outside the Mind of God. 6 The ego,</string>
                    <string>then, raised the first question that was ever asked, but one it can never answer. 7 That question,</string>
                    <string>"What are you?" was the beginning of doubt. 8 The ego has never answered any questions since,</string>
                    <string>although it has raised a great many. 9 The most inventive activities of the ego have never done more</string>

                    <string>and the ego feels badly in need of allies, though not of brothers. 5 Perceiving something alien to</string>
                    <string>itself in your mind, the ego turns to the body as its ally, because the body is not part of you. 6 This</string>
                    <string>makes the body the ego's friend. 7 It is an alliance frankly based on separation. 8 If you side with</string>

                    <string>child of God, a priceless part of His Kingdom, which He created as part of Him. 2 Nothing else</string>
                    <string>exists and only this is real. 3 You have chosen a sleep in which you have had bad dreams, but the</string>
                    <string>sleep is not real and God calls you to awake. 4 There will be nothing left of your dream when you</string>
                    <string>hear Him, because you will awaken. 5 Your dreams contain many of the ego's symbols and they</string>
                    <string>have confused you. 6 Yet that was only because you were asleep and did not know. 7 When you</string>
                    <string>wake you will see the truth around you and in you, and you will no longer believe in dreams</string>
                    <string>because they will have no reality for you. 8 Yet the Kingdom and all that you have created there will</string>
                    <string>have great reality for you, because they are beautiful and true.</string>

                    <string>time spent on questioning in the dream has given way to creation and to its eternity. 6 You are as</string>
                    <string>certain as God because you are as true as He is, but what was once certain in your mind has become</string>

                    <string>are potentials, not accomplishments. 2 Your abilities are useless in the presence of God's</string>
                    <string>accomplishments, and also of yours. 3 Accomplishments are results that have been achieved. 4</string>
                    <string>When they are perfect, abilities are meaningless. 5 It is curious that the perfect must now be</string>
                    <string>perfected. 6 In fact, it is impossible. 7 Remember, however, that when you put yourself in an</string>

                    <string>God created, but it is the kindest solution possible for what you made. 3 In an impossible situation,</string>
                    <string>you can develop your abilities to the point where they can get you out of it. 4 You have a Guide to</string>
                    <string>how to develop them, but you have no commander except yourself. 5 This leaves you in charge of</string>
                    <string>the Kingdom, with both a Guide to find it and a means to keep it. 6 You have a model to follow</string>
                    <string>who will strengthen your command, and never detract from it in any way. 7 You therefore retain the</string>

                    <string>You would be in an impossible situation if God showed you your perfection, and proved to you that</string>
                    <string>you were wrong. 3 This would demonstrate that the perfect are inadequate to bring themselves to the</string>
                    <string>awareness of their perfection, and thus side with the belief that those who have everything need help</string>
                    <string>and are therefore helpless. 4 This is the kind of "reasoning" in which the ego engages. 5 God, Who</string>
                    <string>knows that His creations are perfect, does not affront them. 6 This would be as impossible as the</string>

                    <string>because the laws are true, but because you made them. 5 What would be gained if God proved to</string>
                    <string>you that you have thought insanely? 6 Can God lose His Own certainty? 7 I have frequently said</string>
                    <string>that what you teach you are. 8 Would you have God teach you that you have sinned? 9 If He</string>
                    <string>confronted the self you made with the truth He created for you, what could you be but afraid? 10</string>
                    <string>You would doubt your right mind, which is the only place where you can find the sanity He gave</string>

                    <string>was not a loss of perfection, but a failure in communication. 6 A harsh and strident form of</string>
                    <string>communication arose as the ego's voice. 7 It could not shatter the peace of God, but it could shatter</string>
                    <string>yours. 8 God did not blot it out, because to eradicate it would be to attack it. 9 Being questioned, He</string>

                    <string>to make you equal with Him. 2 You had already taught yourself wrongly, having believed what was</string>
                    <string>not true. 3 You did not believe in your own perfection. 4 Would God teach you that you had made a</string>
                    <string>split mind, when He knows your mind only as whole? 5 What God does know is that His</string>
                    <string>communication channels are not open to Him, so that He cannot impart His joy and know that His</string>
                    <string>children are wholly joyous. 6 Giving His joy is an ongoing process, not in time but in eternity. 7</string>
                    <string>God's extending outward, though not His completeness, is blocked when the Sonship does not</string>
                    <string>communicate with Him as one. 8 So He thought, "My children sleep and must be awakened."/p&gt;</string>

                    <string>frighten them, but will merely remind them that the night is over and the light has come? 2 You do</string>
                    <string>not inform them that the nightmares that frightened them so badly are not real, because children</string>
                    <string>believe in magic. 3 You merely reassure them that they are safe now. 4 Then you train them to</string>
                    <string>recognize the difference between sleeping and waking, so they will understand they need not be</string>
                    <string>afraid of dreams. 5 And so when bad dreams come, they will themselves call on the light to dispel</string>

                    <string>you must avoid to escape from harm, but what you need to learn to have joy. 3 Consider the fear</string>
                    <string>and confusion a child would experience if he were told, "Do not do this because it will hurt you and</string>
                    <string>make you unsafe; but if you do that instead, you will escape from harm and be safe, and then you</string>
                    <string>will not be afraid." 4 It is surely better to use only three words: "Do only that!" 5 This simple</string>

                    <string>more certain. 3 Children do confuse fantasy and reality, and they are frightened because they do not</string>
                    <string>recognize the difference. 4 The Holy Spirit makes no distinction among dreams. 5 He merely shines</string>
                    <string>them away. 6 His light is always the Call to awaken, whatever you have been dreaming. 7 Nothing</string>
                    <string>lasting lies in dreams, and the Holy Spirit, shining with the light from God Himself, speaks only for</string>

                    <string>through death, because death is nothing. 3 Everything is accomplished through life, and life is of the</string>

                    <string>5 If we share the same mind, you can overcome death because I did. 6 Death is an attempt to resolve</string>

                    <string>2 The body is the symbol of what you think you are. 3 It is clearly a separation device, and therefore</string>
                    <string>does not exist. 4 The Holy Spirit, as always, takes what you have made and translates it into a</string>
                    <string>learning device. 5 Again as always, He reinterprets what the ego uses as an argument for separation</string>
                    <string>into a demonstration against it. 6 If the mind can heal the body, but the body cannot heal the mind,</string>
                    <string>then the mind must be stronger than the body. 7 Every miracle demonstrates this.</string>

                    <string>cannot be part of you. 4 To be of one mind is meaningful, but to be one body is meaningless. 5 By</string>

                    <string>to you by now, but it has not yet become believable. 3 Therefore, you do not understand it and</string>
                    <string>cannot use it. 4 We have too much to accomplish on behalf of the Kingdom to let this crucial</string>
                    <string>concept slip away. 5 It is a real foundation stone of the thought system I teach and want you to</string>
                    <string>teach. 6 You cannot perform miracles without believing it, because it is a belief in perfect equality. 7</string>
                    <string>Only one equal gift can be offered to the equal Sons of God, and that is full appreciation. 8 Nothing</string>
                    <string>more and nothing less. 9 Without a range, order of difficulty is meaningless, and there must be no</string>

                    <string>ultimately translates perception into knowledge. 2 You do not lose what you communicate. 3 The</string>
                    <string>ego uses the body for attack, for pleasure and for pride. 4 The insanity of this perception makes it a</string>
                    <string>fearful one indeed. 5 The Holy Spirit sees the body only as a means of communication, and because</string>
                    <string>communicating is sharing it becomes communion. 6 Perhaps you think that fear as well as love can</string>
                    <string>be communicated; and therefore can be shared. 7 Yet this is not so real as it may appear. 8 Those</string>
                    <string>who communicate fear are promoting attack, and attack always breaks communication, making it</string>
                    <string>impossible. 9 Egos do join together in temporary allegiance, but always for what each one can get</string>
                    <string>separately. 10 The Holy Spirit communicates only what each one can give to all. 11 He never takes</string>
                    <string>anything back, because He wants you to keep it. 12 Therefore, His teaching begins with the lesson:</string>

                    <string>you must remain. 4 This step may appear to exacerbate conflict rather than resolve it, because it is</string>
                    <string>the beginning step in reversing your perception and turning it right-side up. 5 This conflicts with the</string>

                    <string>on them. 9 This is because everyone identifies himself with his thought system, and every thought</string>
                    <string>system centers on what you believe you are. 10 If the center of the thought system is true, only truth</string>

                    <string>last and final one. 4 Increasing motivation for change in the learner is all that a teacher need do to</string>
                    <string>guarantee change. 5 Change in motivation is a change of mind, and this will inevitably produce</string>
                    <string>fundamental change because the mind is fundamental.</string>

                    <string>T-6.V.B.3. The first step in the reversal or undoing process is the undoing of the getting concept. 2</string>
                    <string>Accordingly, the Holy Spirit's first lesson was "To have, give all to all." 3 I said that this is apt to</string>
                    <string>increase conflict temporarily, and we can clarify this still further now. 4 At this point, the equality</string>
                    <string>of having and being is not yet perceived. 5 Until it is, having appears to be the opposite of giving. 6</string>
                    <string>Therefore, the first lesson seems to contain a contradiction, since it is being learned by a conflicted</string>
                    <string>mind. 7 This means conflicting motivation, and so the lesson cannot be learned consistently as yet. 8</string>
                    <string>Further, the mind of the learner projects its own conflict, and thus does not perceive consistency in</string>
                    <string>the minds of others, making him suspicious of their motivation. 9 This is the real reason why, in</string>
                    <string>many respects, the first lesson is the hardest to learn. 10 Still strongly aware of the ego in yourself,</string>
                    <string>and responding primarily to the ego in others, you are being taught to react to both as if what you</string>
                    <string>do believe is not true.</string>

                    <string>T-6.V.B.4. Upside down as always, the ego perceives the first lesson as insane. 2 In fact, this is its</string>
                    <string>only alternative since the other possibility, which would be much less acceptable to it, would</string>
                    <string>obviously be that it is insane. 3 The ego's judgment, here as always, is predetermined by what it is. 4</string>
                    <string>The fundamental change will still occur with the change of mind in the thinker. 5 Meanwhile, the</string>
                    <string>increasing clarity of the Holy Spirit's Voice makes it impossible for the learner not to listen. 6 For a</string>
                    <string>time, then, he is receiving conflicting messages and accepting both.</string>

                    <string>and relinquish the other. 2 If you identify with your thought system, and you cannot escape this, and</string>
                    <string>if you accept two thought systems which are in complete disagreement, peace of mind is impossible.</string>
                    <string>3 If you teach both, which you will surely do as long as you accept both, you are teaching conflict</string>
                    <string>and learning it. 4 Yet you do want peace, or you would not have called upon the Voice for peace to</string>
                    <string>help you. 5 Its lesson is not insane; the conflict is.</string>

                    <string>only one is real. 3 The ego tries to persuade you that it is up to you to decide which voice is true, but</string>
                    <string>the Holy Spirit teaches you that truth was created by God, and your decision cannot change it. 4 As</string>
                    <string>you begin to realize the quiet power of the Holy Spirit's Voice, and Its perfect consistency, it must</string>
                    <string>dawn on your mind that you are trying to undo a decision that was irrevocably made for you. 5 That</string>
                    <string>is why I suggested before that you remind yourself to allow the Holy Spirit to decide for God for</string>
                    <string>you.</string>

                    <string>however, be insane to believe that it is up to you to decide what God's creations are. 3 The Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit perceives the conflict exactly as it is. 4 Therefore, His second lesson is: 5 To have peace,</string>

                    <string>T-6.V.B.8. This is still a preliminary step, since having and being are still not equated. 2 It is,</string>
                    <string>however, more advanced than the first step, which is really only the beginning of the thought</string>
                    <string>reversal. 3 The second step is a positive affirmation of what you want. 4 This, then, is a step in the</string>
                    <string>direction out of conflict, since it means that alternatives have been considered, and one has been</string>
                    <string>chosen as more desirable. 5 Nevertheless, the term "more desirable" still implies that the desirable</string>
                    <string>has degrees. 6 Therefore, although this step is essential for the ultimate decision, it is clearly not the</string>
                    <string>final one. 7 Lack of order of difficulty in miracles has not yet been accepted, because nothing is</string>
                    <string>difficult that is wholly desired. 8 To desire wholly is to create, and creating cannot be difficult if</string>
                    <string>God Himself created you as a creator.</string>

                    <string>perception that reflects God's knowing. 2 As you take this step and hold this direction, you will be</string>
                    <string>pushing toward the center of your thought system, where the fundamental change will occur. 3 At</string>
                    <string>the second step progress is intermittent, but the second step is easier than the first because it follows.</string>
                    <string>4 Realizing that it must follow is a demonstration of a growing awareness that the Holy Spirit will</string>

                    <string>T-6.V. C.1 Be Vigilant Only for God and His Kingdom We said before that the Holy Spirit is</string>
                    <string>evaluative, and must be. 2 He sorts out the true from the false in your mind, and teaches you to</string>
                    <string>judge every thought you allow to enter it in the light of what God put there. 3 Whatever is in accord</string>
                    <string>with this light He retains, to strengthen the Kingdom in you. 4 What is partly in accord with it He</string>
                    <string>accepts and purifies. 5 But what is out of accord entirely He rejects by judging against. 6 This is</string>
                    <string>how He keeps the Kingdom perfectly consistent and perfectly unified. 7 Remember, however, that</string>
                    <string>what the Holy Spirit rejects the ego accepts. 8 This is because they are in fundamental disagreement</string>
                    <string>about everything, being in fundamental disagreement about what you are. 9 The ego's beliefs on this</string>
                    <string>crucial issue vary, and that is why it promotes different moods. 10 The Holy Spirit never varies on</string>
                    <string>this point, and so the one mood He engenders is joy. 11 He protects it by rejecting everything that</string>
                    <string>does not foster joy, and so He alone can keep you wholly joyous.</string>

                    <string>T-6.V.C.2. The Holy Spirit does not teach you to judge others, because He does not want you to</string>
                    <string>teach error and learn it yourself. 2 He would hardly be consistent if He allowed you to strengthen</string>
                    <string>what you must learn to avoid. 3 In the mind of the thinker, then, He is judgmental, but only in order</string>
                    <string>to unify the mind so it can perceive without judgment. 4 This enables the mind to teach without</string>
                    <string>judgment, and therefore to learn to be without judgment. 5 The undoing is necessary only in your</string>
                    <string>mind, so that you will not project, instead of extend. 6 God Himself has established what you can</string>
                    <string>extend with perfect safety. 7 Therefore, the Holy Spirit's third lesson is: 8 Be vigilant only for God</string>
                    <string>and His Kingdom.</string>

                    <string>reversal, since it implies that there is something you must be vigilant against. 3 It has advanced far</string>
                    <string>from the first lesson, which is merely the beginning of the thought reversal, and also from the</string>
                    <string>second, which is essentially the identification of what is more desirable. 4 This step, which follows</string>
                    <string>from the second as the second follows from the first, emphasizes the dichotomy between the</string>
                    <string>desirable and the undesirable. 5 It therefore makes the ultimate choice inevitable.</string>

                    <string>T-6.V.C.4. While the first step seems to increase conflict and the second may still entail conflict to</string>
                    <string>some extent, this step calls for consistent vigilance against it. 2 I have already told you that you can</string>
                    <string>be as vigilant against the ego as for it. 3 This lesson teaches not only that you can be, but that you</string>
                    <string>must be. 4 It does not concern itself with order of difficulty, but with clear-cut priority for vigilance.</string>
                    <string>09 5 This lesson is unequivocal in that it teaches there must be no exceptions, although it does not</string>
                    <string>deny that the temptation to make exceptions will occur. 6 Here, then, your consistency is called on</string>
                    <string>despite chaos. 7 Yet chaos and consistency cannot coexist for long, since they are mutually</string>
                    <string>exclusive. 8 As long as you must be vigilant against anything, however, you are not recognizing this</string>
                    <string>mutual exclusiveness, and still believe that you can choose either one. 9 By teaching what to</string>
                    <string>choose, the Holy Spirit will ultimately teach you that you need not choose at all. 10 This will finally</string>
                    <string>liberate your mind from choice, and direct it towards creation within the Kingdom.</string>

                    <string>true being, but what you are you must learn to remember. 3 The way to remember it is inherent in</string>
                    <string>the third step, which brings together the lessons implied in the others, and goes beyond them</string>
                    <string>towards real integration. 4 If you allow yourself to have in your mind only what God put there, you</string>
                    <string>are acknowledging your mind as God created it. 5 Therefore, you are accepting it as it is. 6 Since it</string>
                    <string>is whole, you are teaching peace because you believe in it. 7 The final step will still be taken for</string>
                    <string>you by God, but by the third step the Holy Spirit has prepared you for God. 8 He is getting you</string>
                    <string>ready for the translation of having into being by the very nature of the steps you must take with</string>
                    <string>Him.</string>

                    <string>learn what you teach, and that you want to learn peace. 3 This is the condition for identifying with</string>
                    <string>the Kingdom, since it is the condition of the Kingdom. 4 You have believed that you are without the</string>
                    <string>Kingdom, and have therefore excluded yourself from it in your belief. 5 It is therefore essential to</string>
                    <string>teach you that you must be included, and that the belief that you are not is the only thing that you</string>
                    <string>must exclude.</string>

                    <string>the center, where God placed the altar to Himself. 2 Altars are beliefs, but God and His creations</string>
                    <string>are beyond belief because they are beyond question. 3 The Voice for God speaks only for belief</string>
                    <string>beyond question, which is the preparation for being without question. 4 As long as belief in God</string>
                    <string>and His Kingdom is assailed by any doubts in your mind, His perfect accomplishment is not</string>
                    <string>apparent to you. 5 This is why you must be vigilant on God's behalf. 10 6 The ego speaks against</string>
                    <string>His creation, and therefore engenders doubt. 7 You cannot go beyond belief until you believe fully.</string>

                    <string>wholeness, and have learned that it is one. 2 Now you must be vigilant to hold its oneness in your</string>
                    <string>mind because, if you let doubt enter, you will lose awareness of its wholeness and will be unable to</string>
                    <string>teach it. 3 The wholeness of the Kingdom does not depend on your perception, but your awareness</string>
                    <string>of its wholeness does. 4 It is only your awareness that needs protection, since being cannot be</string>
                    <string>assailed. 5 Yet a real sense of being cannot be yours while you are doubtful of what you are. 6 This</string>
                    <string>is why vigilance is essential. 7 Doubts about being must not enter your mind, or you cannot know</string>
                    <string>what you are with certainty. 8 Certainty is of God for you. 9 Vigilance is not necessary for truth, but</string>
                    <string>it is necessary against illusions.</string>

                    <string>making another kingdom that you valued, you did not keep only the Kingdom of God in your mind,</string>
                    <string>and thus placed part of your mind outside it. 5 What you made has imprisoned your will, and given</string>
                    <string>you a sick mind that must be healed. 6 Your vigilance against this sickness is the way to heal it. 7</string>
                    <string>Once your mind is healed it radiates health, and thereby teaches healing. 8 This establishes you as a</string>
                    <string>teacher who teaches like me. 9 Vigilance was required of me as much as of you, and those who</string>

                    <string>willingness to relinquish everything else. 2 The Holy Spirit will enable you to take this step, if you</string>
                    <string>follow Him. 3 Your vigilance is the sign that you want Him to guide you. 4 Vigilance does require</string>
                    <string>effort, but only until you learn that effort itself is unnecessary. 5 You have exerted great effort to</string>
                    <string>preserve what you made because it was not true. 6 Therefore, you must now turn your effort against</string>

                    <string>are. 8 This recognition is wholly without effort since it is already true and needs no protection. 9 It</string>
                    <string>is in the perfect safety of God. 10 Therefore, inclusion is total and creation is without limit. 11</string>

                    <string>T-7.I.1. The creative power of God and His creations is limitless, but they are not in reciprocal</string>
                    <string>relationship. 2 You communicate fully with God, as He does with you. 3 This is an ongoing process</string>
                    <string>in which you share, and because you share it, you are inspired to create like God. 4 Yet in creation</string>
                    <string>you are not in a reciprocal relation to God, since He created you but you did not create Him. 5 I</string>
                    <string>have already told you that only in this respect your creative power differs from His. 6 Even in this</string>
                    <string>world there is a parallel. 7 Parents give birth to children, but children do not give birth to parents. 8</string>
                    <string>They do, however, give birth to their children, and thus give birth as their parents do.</string>

                    <string>3 As God's creative Thought proceeds from Him to you, so must your creative thought proceed from</string>
                    <string>you to your creations. 4 Only in this way can all creative power extend outward. 5 God's</string>
                    <string>accomplishments are not yours, but yours are like His. 6 He created the Sonship and you increase it.</string>
                    <string>7 You have the power to add to the Kingdom, though not to add to the Creator of the Kingdom. 8</string>
                    <string>You claim this power when you become vigilant only for God and His Kingdom. 9 By accepting</string>

                    <string>have always been, because He has always been. 8 Your creations have always been, because you</string>

                    <string>another means that no bargains are possible. 12 3 To gain you must give, not bargain. 4 To bargain</string>
                    <string>is to limit giving, and this is not God's Will. 5 To will with God is to create like Him. 6 God does</string>
                    <string>not limit His gifts in any way. 7 You are His gifts, and so your gifts must be like His. 8 Your gifts</string>

                    <string>complete because the Kingdom of God is whole. 3 I have said that the last step in the reawakening</string>
                    <string>of knowledge is taken by God. 4 This is true, but it is hard to explain in words because words are</string>
                    <string>symbols, and nothing that is true need be explained. 5 However, the Holy Spirit has the task of</string>
                    <string>translating the useless into the useful, the meaningless into the meaningful, and the temporary into</string>
                    <string>the timeless. 6 He can therefore tell you something about this last step.</string>

                    <string>because His creations are changeless. 3 He does nothing last, because He created first and for</string>
                    <string>always. 4 It must be understood that the word "first" as applied to Him is not a time concept. 5 He is</string>
                    <string>first in the sense that He is the First in the Holy Trinity Itself. 6 He is the Prime Creator, because He</string>
                    <string>created His co-creators. 7 Because He did, time applies neither to Him nor to what He created. 8</string>
                    <string>The "last step" that God will take was therefore true in the beginning, is true now, and will be true</string>
                    <string>forever. 9 What is timeless is always there, because its being is eternally changeless. 10 It does not</string>
                    <string>change by increase, because it was forever created to increase. 11 If you perceive it as not increasing</string>
                    <string>you do not know what it is. 12 You also do not know Who created it. 13 God does not reveal this to</string>
                    <string>you because it was never hidden. 14 His light was never obscured, because it is His Will to share it.</string>

                    <string>because of the elements they share, can transfer easily to it. 2 When a brother perceives himself as</string>
                    <string>sick, he is perceiving himself as not whole, and therefore in need. 3 If you, too, see him this way,</string>
                    <string>you are seeing him as if he were absent from the Kingdom or separated from it, thus making the</string>
                    <string>Kingdom itself obscure to both of you. 4 Sickness and separation are not of God, but the Kingdom</string>
                    <string>is. 5 If you obscure the Kingdom, you are perceiving what is not of God.</string>

                    <string>T-7.II.2. To heal, then, is to correct perception in your brother and yourself by sharing the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit with him. 2 This places you both within the Kingdom, and restores its wholeness in your</string>
                    <string>mind. 3 This reflects creation, because it unifies by increasing and integrates by extending. 4 What</string>
                    <string>you project or extend is real for you. 5 This is an immutable law of the mind in this world as well as</string>
                    <string>in the Kingdom. 6 However, the content is different in this world, because the thoughts it governs</string>
                    <string>are very different from the Thoughts in the Kingdom. 7 Laws must be adapted to circumstances if</string>
                    <string>they are to maintain order. 8 The outstanding characteristic of the laws of mind as they operate in</string>
                    <string>this world is that by obeying them, and I assure you that you must obey them, you can arrive at</string>
                    <string>diametrically opposed results. 9 This is because the laws have been adapted to the circumstances of</string>
                    <string>this world, in which diametrically opposed outcomes seem possible because you can respond to two</string>
                    <string>conflicting voices.</string>

                    <string>believe." 2 This is its teaching form, because outside the Kingdom learning is essential. 3 This form</string>
                    <string>implies that you will learn what you are from what you have projected onto others, and therefore</string>
                    <string>believe they are. 4 In the Kingdom there is no teaching or learning, because there is no belief. 5</string>
                    <string>There is only certainty. 6 God and His Sons, in the surety of being, know that what you extend you</string>
                    <string>are. 7 That form of the law is not adapted at all, being the law of creation. 8 God Himself created</string>
                    <string>the law by creating by it. 9 And His Sons, who create like Him, follow it gladly, knowing that the</string>
                    <string>increase of the Kingdom depends on it, just as their own creation did. 14</string>

                    <string>T-7.II.4. Laws must be communicated if they are to be helpful. 2 In effect, they must be translated</string>
                    <string>for those who speak different languages. 3 Nevertheless, a good translator, although he must alter</string>
                    <string>the form of what he translates, never changes the meaning. 4 In fact, his whole purpose is to change</string>
                    <string>the form so that the original meaning is retained. 5 The Holy Spirit is the Translator of the laws of</string>
                    <string>God to those who do not understand them. 6 You could not do this yourself because a conflicted</string>
                    <string>mind cannot be faithful to one meaning, and will therefore change the meaning to preserve the</string>

                    <string>preserve the original meaning in all respects and in all languages. 3 Therefore, He opposes the idea</string>
                    <string>that differences in form are meaningful, emphasizing always that these differences do not matter. 4</string>
                    <string>The meaning of His message is always the same; only the meaning matters. 5 God's law of creation</string>
                    <string>does not involve the use of truth to convince His Sons of truth. 6 The extension of truth, which is</string>
                    <string>the law of the Kingdom, rests only on the knowledge of what truth is. 7 This is your inheritance and</string>
                    <string>requires no learning at all, but when you disinherited yourself you became a learner of necessity.</string>

                    <string>lesson in remembering. 4 I said before that He teaches remembering and forgetting, but the</string>
                    <string>forgetting is only to make the remembering consistent. 5 You forget in order to remember better. 6</string>
                    <string>You will not understand His translations while you listen to two ways of interpreting them. 7</string>
                    <string>Therefore you must forget or relinquish one to understand the other. 8 This is the only way you can</string>

                    <string>and therefore in need of allies. 2 You who are not at war must look for brothers and recognize all</string>
                    <string>whom you see as brothers, because only equals are at peace. 3 Because God's equal Sons have</string>
                    <string>everything, they cannot compete. 16 4 Yet if they perceive any of their brothers as anything other</string>
                    <string>than their perfect equals, the idea of competition has entered their minds. 5 Do not underestimate</string>
                    <string>your need to be vigilant against this idea, because all your conflicts come from it. 6 It is the belief</string>
                    <string>that conflicting interests are possible, and therefore you have accepted the impossible as true. 7 Is</string>

                    <string>4 It seems to be, but seeming and reality are hardly the same. 5 You who are the Kingdom are not</string>
                    <string>concerned with seeming. 6 Reality is yours because you are reality. 7 This is how having and being</string>

                    <string>miracles the Holy Spirit inspires can have no order of difficulty, because every part of creation is of</string>

                    <string>reminds you of it. 6 When you heal, you are remembering the laws of God and forgetting the laws</string>
                    <string>of the ego. 7 I said before that forgetting is merely a way of remembering better. 8 It is therefore not</string>

                    <string>has made, to teach the opposite of what the ego has "learned." 4 The kind of learning is as irrelevant</string>
                    <string>as is the particular ability that was applied to the learning. 5 All you need do is make the effort to</string>
                    <string>learn, for the Holy Spirit has a unified goal for the effort. 6 If different abilities are applied long</string>
                    <string>enough to one goal, the abilities themselves become unified. 7 This is because they are channelized</string>
                    <string>in one direction, or in one way. 8 Ultimately, then, they all contribute to one result, and by so doing,</string>
                    <string>their similarity rather than their differences is emphasized.</string>

                    <string>healing you learn of wholeness, and by learning of wholeness you learn to remember God. 4 You</string>
                    <string>have forgotten Him, but the Holy Spirit understands that your forgetting must be translated into a</string>

                    <string>3 The Holy Spirit always seeks to unify and heal. 4 As you heal you are healed, because the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit sees no order of difficulty in healing. 5 Healing is the way to undo the belief in differences,</string>
                    <string>being the only way of perceiving the Sonship as one. 6 This perception is therefore in accord with</string>
                    <string>the laws of God, even in a state of mind that is out of accord with His. 7 The strength of right</string>
                    <string>perception is so great that it brings the mind into accord with His, because it serves His Voice,</string>

                    <string>and that it can offer you its own "will" as a gift. 3 You do not want it. 4 It is not a gift. 5 It is</string>
                    <string>nothing at all. 6 God has given you a gift that you both have and are. 7 When you do not use it, you</string>
                    <string>forget that you have it. 8 By not remembering it, you do not know what you are. 9 Healing, then, is</string>
                    <string>a way of approaching knowledge by thinking in accordance with the laws of God, and recognizing</string>
                    <string>their universality. 10 Without this recognition, you have made the laws meaningless to you. 11 Yet</string>

                    <string>your brother. 8 This strengthens the Holy Spirit in both of you, because it is a refusal to</string>
                    <string>acknowledge fear. 9 Love needs only this invitation. 10 It comes freely to all the Sonship, being</string>
                    <string>what the Sonship is. 11 By your awakening to it, you are merely forgetting what you are not. 12</string>

                    <string>communication has such a direct connection with healing that it does need clarification. 4 The</string>

                    <string>because it is also the impulse to create, it can only teach you that the body can both communicate</string>
                    <string>and create, and therefore does not need the mind. 3 The ego thus tries to teach you that the body can</string>
                    <string>act like the mind, and is therefore self-sufficient. 4 Yet we have learned that behavior is not the</string>
                    <string>level for either teaching or learning, since you can act in accordance with what you do not believe. 5</string>
                    <string>To do this, however, will weaken you as a teacher and a learner because, as has been repeatedly</string>

                    <string>Healing is the Holy Spirit's form of communication in this world, and the only one He accepts. 3 He</string>
                    <string>recognizes no other, because He does not accept the ego's confusion of mind and body. 4 Minds can</string>
                    <string>communicate, but they cannot hurt. 5 The body in the service of the ego can hurt other bodies, but</string>
                    <string>this cannot occur unless the body has already been confused with the mind. 6 This situation, too,</string>
                    <string>can be used either for healing or for magic, but you must remember that magic always involves the</string>
                    <string>belief that healing is harmful. 7 This belief is its totally insane premise, and so it proceeds</string>

                    <string>Unless the healer always heals by Him the results will vary. 3 Yet healing itself is consistent, since</string>
                    <string>only consistency is conflict-free, and only the conflict-free are whole. 4 By accepting exceptions</string>
                    <string>and acknowledging that he can sometimes heal and sometimes not, the healer is obviously accepting</string>
                    <string>inconsistency. 5 He is therefore in conflict, and is teaching conflict. 6 Can anything of God not be</string>
                    <string>for all and for always? 7 Love is incapable of any exceptions. 8 Only if there is fear does the idea of</string>
                    <string>exceptions seem to be meaningful. 9 Exceptions are fearful because they are made by fear. 10 The</string>
                    <string>"fearful healer" is a contradiction in terms, and is therefore a concept that only a conflicted mind</string>

                    <string>does. 5 Fear produces dissociation, because it induces separation. 6 Healing always produces</string>
                    <string>harmony, because it proceeds from integration. 7 It is predictable because it can be counted on. 8</string>
                    <string>Everything that is of God can be counted on, because everything of God is wholly real. 9 Healing</string>
                    <string>can be counted on because it is inspired by His Voice, and is in accord with His laws. 10 Yet if</string>
                    <string>healing is consistent it cannot be inconsistently understood. 11 Understanding means consistency</string>
                    <string>because God means consistency. 12 Since that is His meaning, it is also yours. 13 Your meaning</string>
                    <string>cannot be out of accord with His, because your whole meaning and your only meaning comes from</string>
                    <string>His and is like His. 14 God cannot be out of accord with Himself, and you cannot be out of accord</string>

                    <string>changeless mind in your brother by realizing that he could not have changed his mind. 3 That is how</string>
                    <string>you perceive the Holy Spirit in him. 4 It is only the Holy Spirit in him that never changes His Mind.</string>
                    <string>5 He himself may think he can, or he would not perceive himself as sick. 6 He therefore does not</string>
                    <string>know what his Self is. 7 If you see only the changeless in him you have not really changed him. 8</string>
                    <string>By changing your mind about his for him, you help him undo the change his ego thinks it has made</string>
                    <string>in him.</string>

                    <string>or an idol that you may worship out of fear, but will never love. 3 The other shows you only truth,</string>
                    <string>which you will love because you will understand it. 4 Understanding is appreciation, because what</string>
                    <string>you understand you can identify with, and by making it part of you, you have accepted it with love.</string>
                    <string>5 That is how God Himself created you; in understanding, in appreciation and in love. 6 The ego is</string>
                    <string>totally unable to understand this, because it does not understand what it makes, does not appreciate</string>
                    <string>it and does not love it. 7 It incorporates to take away. 8 It literally believes that every time it</string>
                    <string>deprives someone of something, it has increased. 9 I have spoken often of the increase of the</string>
                    <string>Kingdom by your creations, which can only be created as you were. 10 The whole glory and perfect</string>
                    <string>joy that is the Kingdom lies in you to give. 11 Do you not want to give it?</string>

                    <string>me is to forget yourself and Him Who created you. 3 Our brothers are forgetful. 4 That is why they</string>
                    <string>need your remembrance of me and of Him Who created me. 5 Through this remembrance, you can</string>
                    <string>change their minds about themselves, as I can change yours. 6 Your mind is so powerful a light that</string>
                    <string>you can look into theirs and enlighten them, as I can enlighten yours. 7 I do not want to share my</string>
                    <string>body in communion because this is to share nothing. 8 Would I try to share an illusion with the</string>
                    <string>most holy children of a most holy Father? 9 Yet I do want to share my mind with you because we</string>
                    <string>are of one Mind, and that Mind is ours. 10 See only this Mind everywhere, because only this is</string>
                    <string>everywhere and in everything. 11 It is everything because it encompasses all things within itself. 12</string>

                    <string>shine back upon you and on the whole Sonship, because this is your proper gift to God. 5 He will</string>
                    <string>accept it and give it to the Sonship, because it is acceptable to Him and therefore to His Sons. 6 This</string>
                    <string>is true communion with the Holy Spirit, Who sees the altar of God in everyone, and by bringing it</string>
                    <string>to your appreciation, He calls upon you to love God and His creation. 7 You can appreciate the</string>
                    <string>Sonship only as one. 8 This is part of the law of creation, and therefore governs all thought.</string>

                    <string>impossible, however, to see something in part of it that you will not attribute to all of it. 3 That is</string>
                    <string>why attack is never discrete, and why it must be relinquished entirely. 4 If it is not relinquished</string>
                    <string>entirely it is not relinquished at all. 5 Fear and love make or create, depending on whether the ego or</string>
                    <string>the Holy Spirit begets or inspires them, but they will return to the mind of the thinker and they will</string>
                    <string>affect his total perception. 6 That includes his concept of God, of His creations and of his own. 7 He</string>
                    <string>will not appreciate any of Them if he regards Them fearfully. 8 He will appreciate all of Them if he</string>

                    <string>and therefore does not understand what love is. 3 If it does not understand what love is, it cannot</string>
                    <string>perceive itself as loving. 4 This loses the awareness of being, induces feelings of unreality and</string>
                    <string>results in utter confusion. 5 Your thinking has done this because of its power, but your thinking can</string>
                    <string>also save you from this because its power is not of your making. 6 Your ability to direct your</string>
                    <string>thinking as you choose is part of its power. 7 If you do not believe you can do this you have denied</string>
                    <string>the power of your thought, and thus rendered it powerless in your belief.</string>

                    <string>T-7.VI.3. The ingeniousness of the ego to preserve itself is enormous, but it stems from the very</string>
                    <string>power of the mind the ego denies. 2 This means that the ego attacks what is preserving it, which</string>
                    <string>must result in extreme anxiety. 3 That is why the ego never recognizes what it is doing. 4 It is</string>
                    <string>perfectly logical but clearly insane. 5 The ego draws upon the one source that is totally inimical to</string>
                    <string>its existence for its existence. 6 Fearful of perceiving the power of this source, it is forced to</string>
                    <string>depreciate it. 7 This threatens its own existence, a state which it finds intolerable. 8 Remaining</string>
                    <string>logical but still insane, the ego resolves this completely insane dilemma in a completely insane way.</string>
                    <string>9 It does not perceive its existence as threatened by projecting the threat onto you, and perceiving</string>
                    <string>your being as nonexistent. 10 This ensures its continuance if you side with it, by guaranteeing that</string>
                    <string>you will not know your own safety.</string>

                    <string>T-7.VI.4. The ego cannot afford to know anything. 2 Knowledge is total, and the ego does not</string>
                    <string>believe in totality. 3 This unbelief is its origin, and while the ego does not love you it is faithful to</string>
                    <string>its own antecedents, begetting as it was begotten. 4 Mind always reproduces as it was produced. 5</string>
                    <string>Produced by fear, the ego reproduces fear. 6 This is its allegiance, and this allegiance makes it</string>
                    <string>treacherous to love because you are love. 7 Love is your power, which the ego must deny. 8 It must</string>
                    <string>also deny everything this power gives you because it gives you everything. 9 No one who has</string>
                    <string>everything wants the ego. 10 Its own maker, then, does not want it. 11 Rejection is therefore the</string>
                    <string>only decision the ego could possibly encounter, if the mind that made it knew itself. 12 And if it</string>
                    <string>recognized any part of the Sonship, it would know itself.</string>

                    <string>knowledge. 2 It perceives their threat as total, because it senses that all commitments the mind</string>
                    <string>makes are total. 3 Forced, therefore, to detach itself from you, it is willing to attach itself to anything</string>
                    <string>else. 4 But there is nothing else. 5 The mind can, however, make up illusions, and if it does so it will</string>
                    <string>believe in them, because that is how it made them.</string>

                    <string>at all. 2 They therefore do not exist for Him. 3 He resolves the apparent conflict they engender by</string>
                    <string>perceiving conflict as meaningless. 4 I have said before that the Holy Spirit perceives the conflict</string>
                    <string>exactly as it is, and it is meaningless. 5 The Holy Spirit does not want you to understand conflict;</string>
                    <string>He wants you to realize that, because conflict is meaningless, it is not understandable. 6 As I have</string>
                    <string>already said, understanding brings appreciation and appreciation brings love. 7 Nothing else can be</string>
                    <string>understood, because nothing else is real and therefore nothing else has meaning.</string>

                    <string>anything but God and His Kingdom. 2 The only reason you may find this hard to accept is because</string>
                    <string>you may still think there is something else. 3 Belief does not require vigilance unless it is conflicted.</string>
                    <string>4 If it is, there are conflicting components within it that have led to a state of war, and vigilance has</string>
                    <string>therefore become essential. 5 Vigilance has no place in peace. 6 It is necessary against beliefs that</string>
                    <string>are not true, and would never have been called upon by the Holy Spirit if you had not believed the</string>
                    <string>untrue. 7 When you believe something, you have made it true for you. 8 When you believe what</string>
                    <string>God does not know, your thought seems to contradict His, and this makes it appear as if you are</string>

                    <string>T-7.VI.8. I have repeatedly emphasized that the ego does believe it can attack God, and tries to</string>
                    <string>persuade you that you have done this. 2 If the mind cannot attack, the ego proceeds perfectly</string>
                    <string>logically to the belief that you must be a body. 3 By not seeing you as you are, it can see itself as it</string>
                    <string>wants to be. 4 Aware of its weakness the ego wants your allegiance, but not as you really are. 5 The</string>
                    <string>ego therefore wants to engage your mind in its own delusional system, because otherwise the light</string>
                    <string>of your understanding would dispel it. 6 It wants no part of truth, because the ego itself is not true. 7</string>
                    <string>If truth is total, the untrue cannot exist. 8 Commitment to either must be total; they cannot coexist in</string>
                    <string>your mind without splitting it. 9 If they cannot coexist in peace, and if you want peace, you must</string>
                    <string>give up the idea of conflict entirely and for all time. 10 This requires vigilance only as long as you</string>
                    <string>do not recognize what is true. 11 While you believe that two totally contradictory thought systems</string>

                    <string>you, when you are thinking insanely. 3 What you are is not established by your perception, and is</string>
                    <string>not influenced by it at all. 4 Perceived problems in identification at any level are not problems of</string>
                    <string>fact. 5 They are problems of understanding, since their presence implies a belief that what you are is</string>

                    <string>T-7.VII.1. Whenever you deny a blessing to a brother you will feel deprived, because denial is as</string>
                    <string>total as love. 2 It is as impossible to deny part of the Sonship as it is to love it in part. 3 Nor is it</string>
                    <string>possible to love it totally at times. 4 You cannot be totally committed sometimes. 5 Denial has no</string>
                    <string>power in itself, but you can give it the power of your mind, whose power is without limit. 6 If you</string>
                    <string>use it to deny reality, reality is gone for you. 7 Reality cannot be partly appreciated. 8 That is why</string>
                    <string>denying any part of it means you have lost the awareness of all of it. 9 Yet denial is a defense, and</string>
                    <string>so it is as capable of being used positively as well as negatively. 10 Used negatively it will be</string>
                    <string>destructive, because it will be used for attack. 11 But in the service of the Holy Spirit, it can help</string>
                    <string>you recognize part of reality, and thus appreciate all of it. 12 Mind is too powerful to be subject to</string>
                    <string>exclusion. 13 You will never be able to exclude yourself from your thoughts.</string>

                    <string>blessing. 5 Those who attack do not know they are blessed. 6 They attack because they believe they</string>
                    <string>are deprived. 7 Give, therefore, of your abundance, and teach your brothers theirs. 8 Do not share</string>

                    <string>that others are taking it from you. 4 You must be fearful if you believe that your brother is attacking</string>

                    <string>Projection always sees your wishes in others. 5 If you choose to separate yourself from God, that is</string>

                    <string>T-7.VIII.1. We have said that without projection there can be no anger, but it is also true that</string>
                    <string>without extension there can be no love. 2 These reflect a fundamental law of the mind, and therefore</string>
                    <string>one that always operates. 3 It is the law by which you create and were created. 4 It is the law that</string>
                    <string>unifies the Kingdom, and keeps it in the Mind of God. 5 To the ego, the law is perceived as a means</string>
                    <string>of getting rid of something it does not want. 6 To the Holy Spirit, it is the fundamental law of</string>
                    <string>sharing, by which you give what you value in order to keep it in your mind. 7 To the Holy Spirit it</string>
                    <string>is the law of extension. 8 To the ego it is the law of deprivation. 9 It therefore produces abundance</string>
                    <string>or scarcity, depending on how you choose to apply it. 10 This choice is up to you, but it is not up to</string>
                    <string>you to decide whether or not you will utilize the law. 11 Every mind must project or extend, because</string>

                    <string>between projection and anger can be finally undone. 2 The ego always tries to preserve conflict. 3 It</string>
                    <string>is very ingenious in devising ways that seem to diminish conflict, because it does not want you to</string>
                    <string>find conflict so intolerable that you will insist on giving it up. 4 The ego therefore tries to persuade</string>
                    <string>you that it can free you of conflict, lest you give the ego up and free yourself. 5 Using its own</string>
                    <string>warped version of the laws of God, the ego utilizes the power of the mind only to defeat the mind's</string>
                    <string>real purpose. 6 It projects conflict from your mind to other minds, in an attempt to persuade you that</string>

                    <string>T-7.VIII.3. There are two major errors involved in this attempt. 2 First, strictly speaking, conflict</string>
                    <string>cannot be projected because it cannot be shared. 3 Any attempt to keep part of it and get rid of</string>
                    <string>another part does not really mean anything. 4 Remember that a conflicted teacher is a poor teacher</string>
                    <string>and a poor learner. 5 His lessons are confused, and their transfer value is limited by his confusion. 6</string>
                    <string>The second error is the idea that you can get rid of something you do not want by giving it away. 7</string>
                    <string>Giving it is how you keep it. 8 The belief that by seeing it outside you have excluded it from within</string>
                    <string>is a complete distortion of the power of extension. 9 That is why those who project are vigilant for</string>
                    <string>their own safety. 10 They are afraid that their projections will return and hurt them. 11 Believing</string>
                    <string>they have blotted their projections from their own minds, they also believe their projections are</string>
                    <string>trying to creep back in. 12 Since the projections have not left their minds, they are forced to engage</string>
                    <string>in constant activity in order not to recognize this.</string>

                    <string>There is no way out of this, because it is impossible to fragment the mind. 3 To fragment is to break</string>
                    <string>into pieces, and mind cannot attack or be attacked. 4 The belief that it can, an error the ego always</string>
                    <string>makes, underlies its whole use of projection. 5 It does not understand what mind is, and therefore</string>
                    <string>does not understand what you are. 6 Yet its existence is dependent on your mind, because the ego is</string>
                    <string>your belief. 7 The ego is a confusion in identification. 8 Never having had a consistent model, it</string>
                    <string>never developed consistently. 9 It is the product of the misapplication of the laws of God by</string>

                    <string>judgment alone. 3 By accepting the Atonement for yourself, you are deciding against the belief that</string>
                    <string>you can be alone, thus dispelling the idea of separation and affirming your true identification with</string>
                    <string>the whole Kingdom as literally part of you. 4 This identification is as beyond doubt as it is beyond</string>

                    <string>your gifts to the Sonship, or you withhold yourself from God! 4 Selfishness is of the ego, but Self-fullness is of spirit because that is how God created it. 5 The Holy Spirit is in the part of the mind</string>
                    <string>that lies between the ego and the spirit, mediating between them always in favor of the spirit. 6 To</string>
                    <string>the ego this is partiality, and it responds as if it were being sided against. 7 To spirit this is truth,</string>

                    <string>rendering its creations equally whole and equal in perfection. 3 The ego cannot prevail against a</string>
                    <string>totality that includes God, and any totality must include God. 4 Everything He created is given all</string>
                    <string>His power, because it is part of Him and shares His Being with Him. 5 Creating is the opposite of</string>
                    <string>loss, as blessing is the opposite of sacrifice. 6 Being must be extended. 7 That is how it retains the</string>
                    <string>knowledge of itself. 8 Spirit yearns to share its being as its Creator did. 9 Created by sharing, its will</string>
                    <string>is to create. 10 It does not wish to contain God, but wills to extend His Being.</string>

                    <string>you perceive yourself as unfulfilled. 6 Unless you create you are unfulfilled, but God does not know</string>
                    <string>unfulfillment and therefore you must create. 7 You may not know your own creations, but this can</string>

                    <string>yourself and you are not whole. 4 A split mind cannot perceive its fullness, and needs the miracle of</string>
                    <string>its wholeness to dawn upon it and heal it. 5 This reawakens the wholeness in it, and restores it to the</string>
                    <string>Kingdom because of its acceptance of wholeness. 6 The full appreciation of the mind's Self-fullness</string>
                    <string>makes selfishness impossible and extension inevitable. 7 That is why there is perfect peace in the</string>

                    <string>Your Self-fullness is as boundless as God's. 8 Like His, It extends forever and in perfect peace. 9 Its</string>

                    <string>ego's reasoning to its logical conclusion, which is total confusion about everything. 3 If you really</string>
                    <string>saw this result you could not want it. 4 The only reason you could possibly want any part of it is</string>
                    <string>because you do not see the whole of it. 5 You are willing to look at the ego's premises, but not at</string>
                    <string>their logical outcome. 6 Is it not possible that you have done the same thing with the premises of</string>
                    <string>God? 7 Your creations are the logical outcome of His premises. 8 His thinking has established them</string>
                    <string>for you. 9 They are exactly where they belong. 10 They belong in your mind as part of your</string>
                    <string>identification with His, but your state of mind and your recognition of what is in it depend on what</string>
                    <string>you believe about your mind. 11 Whatever these beliefs may be, they are the premises that will</string>

                    <string>prevent. 3 It is the logical outcome of what you are. 4 The ability to see a logical outcome depends</string>
                    <string>on the willingness to see it, but its truth has nothing to do with your willingness. 5 Truth is God's</string>
                    <string>Will. 6 Share His Will and you share what He knows. 7 Deny His Will as yours, and you are</string>
                    <string>denying His Kingdom and yours.</string>

                    <string>this goal if he recognized it. 3 The problem is not whether what the Holy Spirit says is true, but</string>
                    <string>whether you want to listen to what He says. 4 You no more recognize what is painful than you</string>
                    <string>know what is joyful, and are, in fact, very apt to confuse the two. 5 The Holy Spirit's main function</string>
                    <string>is to teach you to tell them apart. 6 What is joyful to you is painful to the ego, and as long as you</string>
                    <string>are in doubt about what you are, you will be confused about joy and pain. 7 This confusion is the</string>
                    <string>cause of the whole idea of sacrifice. 8 Obey the Holy Spirit, and you will be giving up the ego. 9</string>
                    <string>But you will be sacrificing nothing. 10 On the contrary, you will be gaining everything. 11 If you</string>

                    <string>You believe that doing the opposite of God's Will can be better for you. 4 You also believe that it is</string>
                    <string>possible to do the opposite of God's Will. 5 Therefore, you believe that an impossible choice is open</string>
                    <string>to you, and one which is both fearful and desirable. 6 Yet God wills. 7 He does not wish. 8 Your</string>
                    <string>will is as powerful as His because it is His. 9 The ego's wishes do not mean anything, because the</string>
                    <string>ego wishes for the impossible. 10 You can wish for the impossible, but you can will only with God.</string>
                    <string>11 This is the ego's weakness and your strength.</string>

                    <string>T-7.X.5. The Holy Spirit always sides with you and with your strength. 2 As long as you avoid His</string>
                    <string>guidance in any way, you want to be weak. 3 Yet weakness is frightening. 4 What else, then, can</string>
                    <string>this decision mean except that you want to be fearful? 5 The Holy Spirit never asks for sacrifice, but</string>
                    <string>the ego always does. 6 When you are confused about this distinction in motivation, it can only be</string>
                    <string>due to projection. 7 Projection is a confusion in motivation, and given this confusion, trust becomes</string>
                    <string>impossible. 8 No one gladly obeys a guide he does not trust, but this does not mean that the guide is</string>
                    <string>untrustworthy. 9 In this case, it always means that the follower is. 10 However, this, too, is merely a</string>
                    <string>matter of his own belief. 11 Believing that he can betray, he believes that everything can betray him.</string>
                    <string>12 Yet this is only because he has elected to follow false guidance. 13 Unable to follow this</string>
                    <string>guidance without fear, he associates fear with guidance, and refuses to follow any guidance at all. 14</string>
                    <string>If the result of this decision is confusion, this is hardly surprising.</string>

                    <string>much you may question it. 4 I said before that you are the Will of God. 5 His Will is not an idle</string>
                    <string>wish, and your identification with His Will is not optional, since it is what you are. 6 Sharing His</string>
                    <string>Will with me is not really open to choice, though it may seem to be. 7 The whole separation lies in</string>
                    <string>this error. 8 The only way out of the error is to decide that you do not have to decide anything. 9</string>
                    <string>Everything has been given you by God's decision. 10 That is His Will, and you cannot undo it.</string>

                    <string>joy, and will lead you out of the confusion you have made. 4 There is no confusion in the mind of a</string>

                    <string>T-7.XI.3. Consider the kingdom you have made and judge its worth fairly. 2 Is it worthy to be a</string>
                    <string>home for a child of God? 3 Does it protect his peace and shine love upon him? 4 Does it keep his</string>
                    <string>heart untouched by fear, and allow him to give always, without any sense of loss? 5 Does it teach</string>
                    <string>him that this giving is his joy, and that God Himself thanks him for his giving? 6 That is the only</string>
                    <string>environment in which you can be happy. 7 You cannot make it, any more than you can make</string>
                    <string>yourself. 8 It has been created for you, as you were created for it. 9 God watches over His children</string>
                    <string>and denies them nothing. 10 Yet when they deny Him they do not know this, because they deny</string>
                    <string>themselves everything. 11 You who could give the Love of God to everything you see and touch</string>
                    <string>and remember, are literally denying Heaven to yourself.</string>

                    <string>Kingdom. 2 There are no exceptions to this lesson, because the lack of exceptions is the lesson. 3</string>
                    <string>Every Son who returns to the Kingdom with this lesson in his heart has healed the Sonship and</string>
                    <string>given thanks to God. 4 Everyone who learns this lesson has become the perfect teacher, because he</string>

                    <string>and extends out into the darkness of other minds, transforming them into majesty. 3 The Majesty of</string>
                    <string>God is there, for you to recognize and appreciate and know. 4 Recognizing the Majesty of God as</string>
                    <string>your brother is to accept your own inheritance. 5 God gives only equally. 6 If you recognize His gift</string>
                    <string>in anyone, you have acknowledged what He has given you. 7 Nothing is so easy to recognize as</string>
                    <string>truth. 8 This is the recognition that is immediate, clear and natural. 9 You have trained yourself not</string>
                    <string>to recognize it, and this has been very difficult for you.</string>

                    <string>T-7.XI.6. Out of your natural environment you may well ask, "What is truth?" since truth is the</string>
                    <string>environment by which and for which you were created. 2 You do not know yourself, because you do</string>
                    <string>not know your Creator. 3 You do not know your creations because you do not know your brothers,</string>
                    <string>who created them with you. 4 I have already said that only the whole Sonship is worthy to be co-creator with God, because only the whole Sonship can create like Him. 5 Whenever you heal a</string>
                    <string>brother by recognizing his worth, you are acknowledging his power to create and yours. 6 He cannot</string>
                    <string>have lost what you recognize, and you must have the glory you see in him. 7 He is a co-creator with</string>
                    <string>God with you. 8 Deny his creative power, and you are denying yours and that of God Who created</string>
                    <string>you.</string>

                    <string>T-7.XI.7. You cannot deny part of truth. 2 You do not know your creations because you do not</string>
                    <string>know their creator. 3 You do not know yourself because you do not know yours. 4 Your creations</string>
                    <string>cannot establish your reality, any more than you can establish God's. 5 But you can know both. 6</string>
                    <string>Being is known by sharing. 7 Because God shared His Being with you, you can know Him. 8 But</string>
                    <string>you must also know all He created, to know what they have shared. 9 Without your Father you will</string>
                    <string>not know your fatherhood. 10 The Kingdom of God includes all His Sons and their children, who</string>
                    <string>are as like the Sons as they are like the Father. 11 Know, then, the Sons of God, and you will know</string>

                    <string>T-8.I.1. Knowledge is not the motivation for learning this course. 2 Peace is. 3 This is the</string>
                    <string>prerequisite for knowledge only because those who are in conflict are not peaceful, and peace is the</string>
                    <string>condition of knowledge because it is the condition of the Kingdom. 4 Knowledge can be restored</string>
                    <string>only when you meet its conditions. 5 This is not a bargain made by God, Who makes no bargains. 6</string>
                    <string>It is merely the result of your misuse of His laws on behalf of an imaginary will that is not His. 7</string>
                    <string>Knowledge is His Will. 8 If you are opposing His Will, how can you have knowledge? 9 I have told</string>
                    <string>you what knowledge offers you, but perhaps you do not yet regard this as wholly desirable. 10 If</string>
                    <string>you did you would not be so ready to throw it away when the ego asks for your allegiance.</string>

                    <string>power to distract you unless you give it the power to do so. 2 The ego's voice is an hallucination. 3</string>
                    <string>You cannot expect it to say "I am not real." 4 Yet you are not asked to dispel your hallucinations</string>
                    <string>alone. 5 You are merely asked to evaluate them in terms of their results to you. 6 If you do not want</string>
                    <string>them on the basis of loss of peace, they will be removed from your mind for you.</string>

                    <string>T-8.I.3. Every response to the ego is a call to war, and war does deprive you of peace. 2 Yet in this</string>
                    <string>war there is no opponent. 3 This is the reinterpretation of reality that you must make to secure peace,</string>
                    <string>and the only one you need ever make. 4 Those whom you perceive as opponents are part of your</string>
                    <string>peace, which you are giving up by attacking them. 5 How can you have what you give up? 6 You</string>
                    <string>share to have, but you do not give it up yourself. 7 When you give up peace, you are excluding</string>
                    <string>yourself from it. 8 This is a condition so alien to the Kingdom that you cannot understand the state</string>
                    <string>that prevails within it.</string>

                    <string>T-8.I.4. Your past learning must have taught you the wrong things, simply because it has not made</string>
                    <string>you happy. 2 On this basis alone its value should be questioned. 3 If learning aims at change, and</string>
                    <string>that is always its purpose, are you satisfied with the changes your learning has brought you? 4</string>
                    <string>Dissatisfaction with learning outcomes is a sign of learning failure, since it means that you did not</string>
                    <string>get what you wanted.</string>

                    <string>T-8.I.5. The curriculum of the Atonement is the opposite of the curriculum you have established for</string>
                    <string>yourself, but so is its outcome. 2 If the outcome of yours has made you unhappy, and if you want a</string>
                    <string>different one, a change in the curriculum is obviously necessary. 3 The first change to be introduced</string>
                    <string>is a change in direction. 4 A meaningful curriculum cannot be inconsistent. 5 If it is planned by two</string>
                    <string>teachers, each believing in diametrically opposed ideas, it cannot be integrated. 6 If it is carried out</string>
                    <string>by these two teachers simultaneously, each one merely interferes with the other. 7 This leads to</string>
                    <string>fluctuation, but not to change. 8 The volatile have no direction. 9 They cannot choose one because</string>
                    <string>they cannot relinquish the other, even if it does not exist. 10 Their conflicted curriculum teaches</string>
                    <string>them that all directions exist, and gives them no rationale for choice.</string>

                    <string>disagreement about everything. 3 Their joint curriculum presents an impossible learning task. 4</string>
                    <string>They are teaching you entirely different things in entirely different ways, which might be possible</string>
                    <string>except that both are teaching you about yourself. 5 Your reality is unaffected by both, but if you</string>
                    <string>listen to both, your mind will be split about what your reality is.</string>

                    <string>T-8.II.1. There is a rationale for choice. 2 Only one Teacher knows what your reality is. 3 If</string>
                    <string>learning to remove the obstacles to that knowledge is the purpose of the curriculum, you must learn</string>
                    <string>it of Him. 4 The ego does not know what it is trying to teach. 5 It is trying to teach you what you</string>
                    <string>are without knowing what you are. 6 It is expert only in confusion. 7 It does not understand anything</string>
                    <string>else. 8 As a teacher, then, the ego is totally confused and totally confusing. 9 Even if you could</string>
                    <string>disregard the Holy Spirit entirely, which is impossible, you could still learn nothing from the ego,</string>
                    <string>because the ego knows nothing.</string>

                    <string>T-8.II.2. Is there any possible reason for choosing a teacher such as this? 2 Does the total disregard</string>
                    <string>of anything it teaches make anything but sense? 3 Is this the teacher to whom a Son of God should</string>
                    <string>turn to find himself? 4 The ego has never given you a sensible answer to anything. 5 Simply on the</string>
                    <string>grounds of your own experience with its teaching, should not this alone disqualify it as your future</string>
                    <string>teacher? 6 Yet the ego has done more harm to your learning than this alone. 7 Learning is joyful if</string>
                    <string>it leads you along your natural path, and facilitates the development of what you have. 8 When you</string>
                    <string>are taught against your nature, however, you will lose by your learning because your learning will</string>
                    <string>imprison you. 9 Your will is in your nature, and therefore cannot go against it.</string>

                    <string>T-8.II.3. The ego cannot teach you anything as long as your will is free, because you will not listen</string>
                    <string>to it. 2 It is not your will to be imprisoned because your will is free. 3 That is why the ego is the</string>
                    <string>denial of free will. 4 It is never God Who coerces you, because He shares His Will with you. 5 His</string>
                    <string>Voice teaches only in accordance with His Will, but that is not the Holy Spirit's lesson because that</string>
                    <string>is what you are. 6 The lesson is that your will and God's cannot be out of accord because they are</string>
                    <string>one. 7 This is the undoing of everything the ego tries to teach. 8 It is not, then, only the direction of</string>

                    <string>be learned, and the attempt to learn it is a violation of your own freedom, making you afraid of your</string>
                    <string>will because it is free. 3 The Holy Spirit opposes any imprisoning of the will of a Son of God,</string>
                    <string>knowing that the Will of the Son is the Father's. 4 The Holy Spirit leads you steadily along the path</string>
                    <string>of freedom, teaching you how to disregard or look beyond everything that would hold you back.</string>

                    <string>is the same as saying He teaches you the difference between imprisonment and freedom. 3 You</string>
                    <string>cannot make this distinction without Him because you have taught yourself that imprisonment is</string>
                    <string>freedom. 4 Believing them to be the same, how can you tell them apart? 5 Can you ask the part of</string>

                    <string>is freedom and His goal is God. 3 Yet He cannot conceive of God without you, because it is not</string>
                    <string>God's Will to be without you. 4 When you have learned that your will is God's, you could no more</string>
                    <string>will to be without Him than He could will to be without you. 5 This is freedom and this is joy. 6</string>
                    <string>Deny yourself this and you are denying God His Kingdom, because He created you for this.</string>

                    <string>meant: The Will of God is without limit, and all power and glory lie within it. 2 It is boundless in</string>
                    <string>strength and in love and in peace. 3 It has no boundaries because its extension is unlimited, and it</string>
                    <string>encompasses all things because it created all things. 4 By creating all things, it made them part of</string>
                    <string>itself. 5 You are the Will of God because that is how you were created. 6 Because your Creator</string>
                    <string>creates only like Himself, you are like Him. 7 You are part of Him Who is all power and glory, and</string>
                    <string>are therefore as unlimited as He is.</string>

                    <string>Kingdom? 2 His appeal, then, is merely to what the Kingdom is, and for its own acknowledgment</string>
                    <string>of what it is. 3 When you acknowledge this you bring the acknowledgment automatically to</string>
                    <string>everyone, because you have acknowledged everyone. 4 By your recognition you awaken theirs, and</string>

                    <string>given you, because it has already been given. 3 Ask for light and learn that you are light. 4 If you</string>
                    <string>want understanding and enlightenment you will learn it, because your decision to learn it is the</string>
                    <string>decision to listen to the Teacher Who knows of light, and can therefore teach it to you. 5 There is no</string>
                    <string>limit on your learning because there is no limit on your mind. 6 There is no limit on His teaching</string>
                    <string>because He was created to teach. 7 Understanding His function perfectly He fulfills it perfectly,</string>

                    <string>there is no other experience. 3 Yet the wish for other experience will block its accomplishment,</string>
                    <string>because God's Will cannot be forced upon you, being an experience of total willingness. 4 The Holy</string>

                    <string>gave Him to you. 6 Only His teaching will release your will to God's, uniting it with His power and</string>
                    <string>glory and establishing them as yours. 7 You share them as God shares them, because this is the</string>

                    <string>in God have the holy function of extending His Fatherhood by placing no limits upon it. 6 Let the</string>

                    <string>There is nothing else to seek. 3 Everyone is looking for himself and for the power and glory he</string>

                    <string>Your power and glory are in him because they are yours. 6 The ego tries to find them in yourself</string>
                    <string>alone, because it does not know where to look. 7 The Holy Spirit teaches you that if you look only</string>
                    <string>at yourself you cannot find yourself, because that is not what you are. 8 Whenever you are with a</string>
                    <string>brother, you are learning what you are because you are teaching what you are. 9 He will respond</string>
                    <string>either with pain or with joy, depending on which teacher you are following. 10 He will be</string>
                    <string>imprisoned or released according to your decision, and so will you. 11 Never forget your</string>
                    <string>responsibility to him, because it is your responsibility to yourself. 12 Give him his place in the</string>

                    <string>alone. 2 To achieve the goal of the curriculum, then, you cannot listen to the ego, whose purpose is</string>
                    <string>to defeat its own goal. 3 The ego does not know this, because it does not know anything. 4 But you</string>
                    <string>can know it, and you will know it if you are willing to look at what the ego would make of you. 5</string>
                    <string>This is your responsibility, because once you have really looked at it you will accept the Atonement</string>
                    <string>for yourself. 6 What other choice could you make? 7 Having made this choice you will understand</string>
                    <string>why you once believed that, when you met someone else, you thought he was someone else. 8 And</string>
                    <string>every holy encounter in which you enter fully will teach you this is not so.</string>

                    <string>in you. 5 God wills no one suffer. 6 He does not will anyone to suffer for a wrong decision,</string>
                    <string>including you. 7 That is why He has given you the means for undoing it. 8 Through His power and</string>
                    <string>glory all your wrong decisions are undone completely, releasing you and your brother from every</string>
                    <string>imprisoning thought any part of the Sonship holds. 9 Wrong decisions have no power, because they</string>
                    <string>are not true. 10 The imprisonment they seem to produce is no more true than they are.</string>

                    <string>because He gives of Himself, and everything belongs to Him. 4 Giving of yourself is the function</string>
                    <string>He gave you. 5 Fulfilling it perfectly will let you remember what you have of Him, and by this you</string>

                    <string>them. 8 Yet if you do, and only if you do, you will feel lonely and helpless, because you are denying</string>

                    <string>dissociating itself from everything. 3 It is therefore an illusion of isolation, maintained by fear of the</string>
                    <string>same loneliness that is its illusion. 4 I said that I am with you always, even unto the end of the</string>
                    <string>world. 5 That is why I am the light of the world. 6 If I am with you in the loneliness of the world,</string>
                    <string>the loneliness is gone. 7 You cannot maintain the illusion of loneliness if you are not alone. 8 My</string>

                    <string>of what it is. 10 Light does not attack darkness, but it does shine it away. 11 If my light goes with</string>
                    <string>you everywhere, you shine it away with me. 12 The light becomes ours, and you cannot abide in</string>
                    <string>darkness any more than darkness can abide wherever you go. 13 The remembrance of me is the</string>

                    <string>T-8.IV.3. You were in darkness until God's Will was done completely by any part of the Sonship. 2</string>
                    <string>When this was done, it was perfectly accomplished by all. 3 How else could it be perfectly</string>
                    <string>accomplished? 4 My mission was simply to unite the will of the Sonship with the Will of the Father</string>
                    <string>by being aware of the Father's Will myself. 5 This is the awareness I came to give you, and your</string>
                    <string>problem in accepting it is the problem of this world. 6 Dispelling it is salvation, and in this sense I</string>
                    <string>am the salvation of the world. 7 The world must therefore despise and reject me, because the world</string>
                    <string>is the belief that love is impossible. 8 If you will accept the fact that I am with you, you are denying</string>
                    <string>the world and accepting God. 9 My will is His, and your decision to hear me is the decision to hear</string>
                    <string>His Voice and abide in His Will. 10 As God sent me to you so will I send you to others. 11 And I</string>

                    <string>want to have it of me, you must give it. 5 Healing does not come from anyone else. 6 You must</string>
                    <string>accept guidance from within. 7 The guidance must be what you want, or it will be meaningless to</string>
                    <string>you. 8 That is why healing is a collaborative venture. 9 I can tell you what to do, but you must</string>
                    <string>collaborate by believing that I know what you should do. 10 Only then will your mind choose to</string>
                    <string>follow me. 11 Without this choice you could not be healed because you would have decided against</string>

                    <string>T-8.IV.5. Healing reflects our joint will. 2 This is obvious when you consider what healing is for. 3</string>
                    <string>Healing is the way in which the separation is overcome. 4 Separation is overcome by union. 5 It</string>
                    <string>cannot be overcome by separating. 6 The decision to unite must be unequivocal, or the mind itself is</string>
                    <string>divided and not whole. 7 Your mind is the means by which you determine your own condition,</string>
                    <string>because mind is the mechanism of decision. 8 It is the power by which you separate or join, and</string>
                    <string>experience pain or joy accordingly. 9 My decision cannot overcome yours, because yours is as</string>
                    <string>powerful as mine. 10 If it were not so the Sons of God would be unequal. 11 All things are possible</string>
                    <string>through our joint decision, but mine alone cannot help you. 12 Your will is as free as mine, and God</string>
                    <string>Himself would not go against it. 13 I cannot will what God does not will. 14 I can offer my strength</string>
                    <string>to make yours invincible, but I cannot oppose your decision without competing with it and thereby</string>
                    <string>violating God's Will for you.</string>

                    <string>Will. 2 God gave your will its power, which I can only acknowledge in honor of His. 3 If you want</string>
                    <string>to be like me I will help you, knowing that we are alike. 4 If you want to be different, I will wait</string>
                    <string>until you change your mind. 5 I can teach you, but only you can choose to listen to my teaching. 6</string>
                    <string>How else can it be, if God's Kingdom is freedom? 7 Freedom cannot be learned by tyranny of any</string>

                    <string>imprisoned yours, and have not let it be free. 3 Of yourself you can do nothing, because of yourself</string>
                    <string>you are nothing. 4 I am nothing without the Father and you are nothing without me, because by</string>
                    <string>denying the Father you deny yourself. 5 I will always remember you, and in my remembrance of</string>
                    <string>you lies your remembrance of yourself. 6 In our remembrance of each other lies our remembrance</string>
                    <string>of God. 7 And in this remembrance lies your freedom because your freedom is in Him. 8 Join, then,</string>

                    <string>Because it is acceptable to Him it is the gift of freedom, which is His Will for all His Sons. 11 By</string>

                    <string>do not love. 4 Therefore, when you seek to imprison anyone, including yourself, you do not love</string>
                    <string>him and you cannot identify with him. 5 When you imprison yourself you are losing sight of your</string>
                    <string>true identification with me and with the Father. 6 Your identification is with the Father and with the</string>

                    <string>recognize it because they prefer the delusion. 4 Judging truth as something they do not want, they</string>

                    <string>their behalf, as I am offering you mine on behalf of yours. 6 Alone we can do nothing, but together</string>
                    <string>our minds fuse into something whose power is far beyond the power of its separate parts. 7 By not</string>
                    <string>being separate, the Mind of God is established in ours and as ours. 8 This Mind is invincible</string>

                    <string>with those who are like you, because perceiving this likeness is to recognize the Father. 6 If your</string>
                    <string>perfection is in Him and only in Him, how can you know it without recognizing Him? 7 The</string>

                    <string>the journey is the way to what is true. 6 Leave all illusions behind, and reach beyond all attempts of</string>
                    <string>the ego to hold you back. 7 I go before you because I am beyond the ego. 8 Reach, therefore, for my</string>

                    <string>it heals by making whole, which is also natural. 3 All mind is whole, and the belief that part of it is</string>
                    <string>physical, or not mind, is a fragmented or sick interpretation. 4 Mind cannot be made physical, but it</string>
                    <string>can be made manifest through the physical if it uses the body to go beyond itself. 5 By reaching out,</string>
                    <string>the mind extends itself. 6 It does not stop at the body, for if it does it is blocked in its purpose. 7 A</string>
                    <string>mind that has been blocked has allowed itself to be vulnerable to attack, because it has turned</string>

                    <string>healing are the normal expressions of a mind that is working through the body, but not in it. 3 If the</string>
                    <string>mind believes the body is its goal it will distort its perception of the body, and by blocking its own</string>

                    <string>one purpose. 4 This releases the mind from the temptation to see the body in many lights, and gives</string>
                    <string>it over entirely to the One Light in which it can be really understood. 5 To confuse a learning device</string>
                    <string>with a curriculum goal is a fundamental confusion that blocks the understanding of both. 6 Learning</string>
                    <string>must lead beyond the body to the re-establishment of the power of the mind in it. 7 This can be</string>
                    <string>accomplished only if the mind extends to other minds, and does not arrest itself in its extension. 8</string>

                    <string>it becomes whole because the mind's purpose is one. 6 Attack can only be an assumed purpose of</string>

                    <string>T-8.VIII.1. Attitudes toward the body are attitudes toward attack. 2 The ego's definitions of anything</string>
                    <string>are childish, and are always based on what it believes the thing is for. 3 This is because it is</string>
                    <string>incapable of true generalizations, and equates what it sees with the function it ascribes to it. 4 It does</string>
                    <string>not equate it with what it is. 5 To the ego the body is to attack with. 6 Equating you with the body, it</string>
                    <string>teaches that you are to attack with. 7 The body, then, is not the source of its own health. 8 The</string>
                    <string>body's condition lies solely in your interpretation of its function. 9 Functions are part of being since</string>
                    <string>they arise from it, but the relationship is not reciprocal. 10 The whole does define the part, but the</string>
                    <string>part does not define the whole. 11 Yet to know in part is to know entirely because of the</string>
                    <string>fundamental difference between knowledge and perception. 12 In perception the whole is built up of</string>
                    <string>parts that can separate and reassemble in different constellations. 13 But knowledge never changes,</string>
                    <string>so its constellation is permanent. 14 The idea of part-whole relationships has meaning only at the</string>
                    <string>level of perception, where change is possible. 15 Otherwise, there is no difference between the part</string>

                    <string>trustworthy because you have not seriously cross-examined him. 3 If you had, you would not</string>
                    <string>consider sickness such a strong witness on behalf of the ego's views. 4 A more honest statement</string>
                    <string>would be that those who want the ego are predisposed to defend it. 5 Therefore, their choice of</string>
                    <string>witnesses should be suspect from the beginning. 6 The ego does not call upon witnesses who would</string>
                    <string>disagree with its case, nor does the Holy Spirit. 7 I have said that judgment is the function of the</string>
                    <string>Holy Spirit, and one He is perfectly equipped to fulfill. 8 The ego as a judge gives anything but an</string>
                    <string>impartial judgment. 9 When the ego calls on a witness, it has already made the witness an ally.</string>

                    <string>however, establishes it as an end because, as such, its true function is obscured. 3 This is the</string>
                    <string>purpose of everything the ego does. 4 Its sole aim is to lose sight of the function of everything. 5 A</string>
                    <string>sick body does not make any sense. 6 It could not make sense because sickness is not what the body</string>
                    <string>is for. 7 Sickness is meaningful only if the two basic premises on which the ego's interpretation of</string>
                    <string>the body rests are true; that the body is for attack, and that you are a body. 8 Without these premises</string>
                    <string>sickness is inconceivable.</string>

                    <string>your vulnerability, and your extreme need to depend on external guidance. 3 The ego uses this as its</string>
                    <string>best argument for your need for its guidance. 4 It dictates endless prescriptions for avoiding</string>
                    <string>catastrophic outcomes. 5 The Holy Spirit, perfectly aware of the same situation, does not bother to</string>
                    <string>analyze it at all. 6 If data are meaningless there is no point in analyzing them. 7 The function of truth</string>
                    <string>is to collect information that is true. 8 Any way you handle error results in nothing. 9 The more</string>
                    <string>complicated the results become the harder it may be to recognize their nothingness, but it is not</string>

                    <string>He knows what the answer to everything is. 3 The ego does not know what a real question is,</string>
                    <string>although it asks an endless number. 4 Yet you can learn this as you learn to question the value of the</string>
                    <string>ego, and thus establish your ability to evaluate its questions. 5 When the ego tempts you to sickness</string>
                    <string>do not ask the Holy Spirit to heal the body, for this would merely be to accept the ego's belief that</string>
                    <string>the body is the proper aim of healing. 6 Ask, rather, that the Holy Spirit teach you the right</string>
                    <string>perception of the body, for perception alone can be distorted. 7 Only perception can be sick, because</string>

                    <string>of waking. 4 This is a pathetic way of trying not to see by rendering the faculties for seeing</string>
                    <string>ineffectual. 5 "Rest in peace" is a blessing for the living, not the dead, because rest comes from</string>
                    <string>waking, not from sleeping. 6 Sleep is withdrawing; waking is joining. 7 Dreams are illusions of</string>
                    <string>joining, because they reflect the ego's distorted notions about what joining is. 8 Yet the Holy Spirit,</string>

                    <string>You can indeed be "drugged" by sleep, if you have misused it on behalf of sickness. 7 Sleep is no</string>
                    <string>more a form of death than death is a form of unconsciousness. 8 Complete unconsciousness is</string>

                    <string>form of sickness is more serious than another, He would be teaching that one error can be more real</string>
                    <string>than another. 4 His function is to distinguish only between the false and the true, replacing the false</string>

                    <string>help you. 2 When I said that the Holy Spirit's function is to sort out the true from the false in your</string>
                    <string>mind, I meant that He has the power to look into what you have hidden and recognize the Will of</string>
                    <string>God there. 3 His recognition of this Will can make it real to you because He is in your mind, and</string>
                    <string>therefore He is your reality. 4 If, then, His perception of your mind brings its reality to you, He is</string>
                    <string>helping you to remember what you are. 5 The only source of fear in this process is what you think</string>
                    <string>you will lose. 6 Yet it is only what the Holy Spirit sees that you can possibly have.</string>

                    <string>anything. 2 But if you ask the sacrifice of reality of yourself, the Holy Spirit must remind you that</string>
                    <string>this is not God's Will because it is not yours. 3 There is no difference between your will and God's.</string>
                    <string>4 If you did not have a split mind, you would recognize that willing is salvation because it is</string>

                    <string>T-9.I.6. It is impossible to communicate in alien tongues. 2 You and your Creator can communicate</string>
                    <string>through creation, because that, and only that is Your joint Will. 3 A divided mind cannot</string>
                    <string>communicate, because it speaks for different things to the same mind. 4 This loses the ability to</string>
                    <string>communicate simply because confused communication does not mean anything. 5 A message cannot</string>
                    <string>be communicated unless it makes sense. 6 How sensible can your messages be, when you ask for</string>
                    <string>what you do not want? 7 Yet as long as you are afraid of your will, that is precisely what you are</string>

                    <string>the kind of questioner you are. 2 You do not ask only for what you want. 3 This is because you are</string>
                    <string>afraid you might receive it, and you would. 4 That is why you persist in asking the teacher who</string>
                    <string>could not possibly give you what you want. 5 Of him you can never learn what it is, and this gives</string>
                    <string>you the illusion of safety. 6 Yet you cannot be safe from truth, but only in truth. 7 Reality is the</string>
                    <string>only safety. 8 Your will is your salvation because it is the same as God's. 9 The separation is nothing</string>
                    <string>more than the belief that it is different.</string>

                    <string>T-9.I.8. No right mind can believe that its will is stronger than God's. 2 If, then, a mind believes that</string>
                    <string>its will is different from His, it can only decide either that there is no God or that God's Will is</string>
                    <string>fearful. 3 The former accounts for the atheist and the latter for the martyr, who believes that God</string>
                    <string>demands sacrifices. 4 Either of these insane decisions will induce panic, because the atheist believes</string>
                    <string>he is alone, and the martyr believes that God is crucifying him. 5 Yet no one really wants either</string>
                    <string>abandonment or retaliation, even though many may seek both. 6 Can you ask the Holy Spirit for</string>
                    <string>"gifts" such as these, and actually expect to receive them? 7 He cannot give you something you do</string>
                    <string>not want. 8 When you ask the Universal Giver for what you do not want, you are asking for what</string>
                    <string>cannot be given because it was never created. 9 It was never created, because it was never your will</string>

                    <string>recognize himself. 2 This recognition is the recognition that his will and God's are one. 3 In the</string>
                    <string>presence of truth, there are no unbelievers and no sacrifices. 4 In the security of reality, fear is</string>
                    <string>totally meaningless. 5 To deny what is can only seem to be fearful. 6 Fear cannot be real without a</string>
                    <string>cause, and God is the only Cause. 7 God is Love and you do want Him. 8 This is your will. 9 Ask</string>
                    <string>for this and you will be answered, because you will be asking only for what belongs to you.</string>

                    <string>can hurt you, and so you are asking for nothing. 2 Any wish that stems from the ego is a wish for</string>
                    <string>nothing, and to ask for it is not a request. 3 It is merely a denial in the form of a request. 4 The Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit is not concerned with form, being aware only of meaning. 5 The ego cannot ask the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit for anything, because there is complete communication failure between them. 6 Yet you can</string>
                    <string>ask for everything of the Holy Spirit, because your requests to Him are real, being of your right</string>
                    <string>mind. 7 Would the Holy Spirit deny the Will of God? 8 And could He fail to recognize it in His</string>

                    <string>would you say of someone who persists in attempting the impossible, believing that to achieve it is</string>
                    <string>to succeed? 3 The belief that you must have the impossible in order to be happy is totally at</string>
                    <string>variance with the principle of creation. 4 God could not will that happiness depended on what you</string>
                    <string>could never have. 5 The fact that God is Love does not require belief, but it does require acceptance.</string>
                    <string>6 It is indeed possible for you to deny facts, although it is impossible for you to change them. 7 If</string>
                    <string>you hold your hands over your eyes, you will not see because you are interfering with the laws of</string>
                    <string>seeing. 8 If you deny love, you will not know it because your cooperation is the law of its being. 9</string>
                    <string>You cannot change laws you did not make, and the laws of happiness were created for you, not by</string>

                    <string>panic. 2 Willing against reality, though impossible, can be made into a very persistent goal even</string>
                    <string>though you do not want it. 3 But consider the result of this strange decision. 4 You are devoting</string>
                    <string>your mind to what you do not want. 5 How real can this devotion be? 6 If you do not want it, it was</string>

                    <string>devoted to. 2 Otherwise you would not have been created perfect. 3 Reality is everything, and you</string>
                    <string>have everything because you are real. 4 You cannot make the unreal because the absence of reality</string>
                    <string>is fearful, and fear cannot be created. 5 As long as you believe that fear is possible, you will not</string>
                    <string>create. 6 Opposing orders of reality make reality meaningless, and reality is meaning.</string>

                    <string>is the simple acceptance of reality, because only that is real. 3 You cannot distort reality and know</string>
                    <string>what it is. 4 And if you do distort reality you will experience anxiety, depression and ultimately</string>

                    <string>look beyond yourself for truth, for truth can only be within you. 6 Say, therefore:</string>

                    <string>also in connection with requests that are strictly in line with this course. 3 The latter in particular</string>

                    <string>want. 3 This is why certain specific forms of healing are not achieved, even when the state of</string>
                    <string>healing is. 4 An individual may ask for physical healing because he is fearful of bodily harm. 5 At</string>
                    <string>the same time, if he were healed physically, the threat to his thought system might be considerably</string>
                    <string>more fearful to him than its physical expression. 6 In this case he is not really asking for release</string>
                    <string>from fear, but for the removal of a symptom that he himself selected. 7 This request is, therefore,</string>
                    <string>not for healing at all.</string>

                    <string>you will merely place yourself in an impossible situation, to which the ego always leads you. 4 The</string>

                    <string>what you have made real? 6 By seeing it clearly, you have made it real and cannot overlook it. 7</string>
                    <string>This is where the ego is forced to appeal to "mysteries," insisting that you must accept the</string>

                    <string>error from the beginning, and thus keeping it unreal for you. 4 Do not let any belief in its realness</string>
                    <string>enter your mind, or you will also believe that you must undo what you have made in order to be</string>

                    <string>you will not find it. 3 The symbols of fantasy are of the ego, and of these you will find many. 4 But</string>
                    <string>do not look for meaning in them. 5 They have no more meaning than the fantasies into which they</string>
                    <string>are woven. 6 Fairy tales can be pleasant or fearful, but no one calls them true. 7 Children may</string>
                    <string>believe them, and so, for a while, the tales are true for them. 8 Yet when reality dawns, the fantasies</string>

                    <string>T-9.V.1. The ego's plan for forgiveness is far more widely used than God's. 2 This is because it is</string>
                    <string>undertaken by unhealed healers, and is therefore of the ego. 3 Let us consider the unhealed healer</string>
                    <string>more carefully now. 4 By definition, he is trying to give what he has not received. 5 If an unhealed</string>
                    <string>healer is a theologian, for example, he may begin with the premise, "I am a miserable sinner, and so</string>
                    <string>are you." 6 If he is a psychotherapist, he is more likely to start with the equally incredible belief that</string>
                    <string>attack is real for both himself and the patient, but that it does not matter for either of them.</string>

                    <string>T-9.V.2. I have repeatedly said that beliefs of the ego cannot be shared, and this is why they are</string>
                    <string>unreal. 2 How, then, can "uncovering" them make them real? 3 Every healer who searches fantasies</string>
                    <string>for truth must be unhealed, because he does not know where to look for truth, and therefore does</string>
                    <string>not have the answer to the problem of healing.</string>

                    <string>T-9.V.3. There is an advantage to bringing nightmares into awareness, but only to teach that they</string>
                    <string>are not real, and that anything they contain is meaningless. 2 The unhealed healer cannot do this</string>
                    <string>because he does not believe it. 3 All unhealed healers follow the ego's plan for forgiveness in one</string>
                    <string>form or another. 4 If they are theologians they are likely to condemn themselves, teach</string>
                    <string>condemnation and advocate a fearful solution. 5 Projecting condemnation onto God, they make Him</string>
                    <string>appear retaliative, and fear His retribution. 6 What they have done is merely to identify with the</string>
                    <string>ego, and by perceiving what it does, condemn themselves because of this confusion. 7 It is</string>
                    <string>understandable that there have been revolts against this concept, but to revolt against it is still to</string>
                    <string>believe in it.</string>

                    <string>T-9.V.4. Some newer forms of the ego's plan are as unhelpful as the older ones, because form does</string>
                    <string>not matter and the content has not changed. 2 In one of the newer forms, for example, a</string>
                    <string>psychotherapist may interpret the ego's symbols in a nightmare, and then use them to prove that the</string>
                    <string>nightmare is real. 3 Having made it real, he then attempts to dispel its effects by depreciating the</string>
                    <string>importance of the dreamer. 4 This would be a healing approach if the dreamer were also identified</string>
                    <string>as unreal. 5 Yet if the dreamer is equated with the mind, the mind's corrective power through the</string>
                    <string>Holy Spirit is denied. 6 This is a contradiction even in the ego's terms, and one which it usually</string>
                    <string>notes even in its confusion.</string>

                    <string>ego strength? 2 Such evident inconsistencies account for why no one has really explained what</string>
                    <string>happens in psychotherapy. 3 Nothing really does. 4 Nothing real has happened to the unhealed</string>
                    <string>healer, and he must learn from his own teaching. 5 His ego will always seek to get something from</string>
                    <string>the situation. 6 The unhealed healer therefore does not know how to give, and consequently cannot</string>
                    <string>share. 7 He cannot correct because he is not working correctively. 8 He believes that it is up to him</string>
                    <string>to teach the patient what is real, although he does not know it himself.</string>

                    <string>you find light by analyzing darkness, as the psychotherapist does, or like the theologian, by</string>
                    <string>acknowledging darkness in yourself and looking for a distant light to remove it, while emphasizing</string>
                    <string>the distance? 4 Healing is not mysterious. 5 Nothing will change unless it is understood, since light</string>
                    <string>is understanding. 6 A "miserable sinner" cannot be healed without magic, nor can an "unimportant</string>
                    <string>mind" esteem itself without magic.</string>

                    <string>T-9.V.7. Both forms of the ego's approach, then, must arrive at an impasse; the characteristic</string>
                    <string>"impossible situation" to which the ego always leads. 2 It may help someone to point out where he</string>
                    <string>is heading, but the point is lost unless he is also helped to change his direction. 3 The unhealed</string>
                    <string>healer cannot do this for him, since he cannot do it for himself. 4 The only meaningful contribution</string>
                    <string>the healer can make is to present an example of one whose direction has been changed for him, and</string>
                    <string>who no longer believes in nightmares of any kind. 5 The light in his mind will therefore answer the</string>
                    <string>questioner, who must decide with God that there is light because he sees it. 6 And by his</string>
                    <string>acknowledgment the healer knows it is there. 7 That is how perception ultimately is translated into</string>
                    <string>knowledge. 8 The miracle worker begins by perceiving light, and translates his perception into</string>
                    <string>sureness by continually extending it and accepting its acknowledgment. 9 Its effects assure him it is</string>
                    <string>there.</string>

                    <string>bring light of himself, for light is not of him. 3 Yet, being for him, it must also be for his patient. 4</string>
                    <string>The Holy Spirit is the only Therapist. 5 He makes healing clear in any situation in which He is the</string>
                    <string>Guide. 6 You can only let Him fulfill His function. 7 He needs no help for this. 8 He will tell you</string>
                    <string>exactly what to do to help anyone He sends to you for help, and will speak to him through you if</string>
                    <string>you do not interfere. 9 Remember that you choose the guide for helping, and the wrong choice will</string>
                    <string>not help. 10 But remember also that the right one will. 11 Trust Him, for help is His function, and</string>
                    <string>He is of God. 12 As you awaken other minds to the Holy Spirit through Him, and not yourself, you</string>
                    <string>will understand that you are not obeying the laws of this world. 13 But the laws you are obeying</string>
                    <string>work. 14 "The good is what works" is a sound though insufficient statement. 15 Only the good can</string>

                    <string>"always"; in His Mind and with a mind like His. 4 In your open mind are your creations, in perfect</string>

                    <string>want anything the world has to offer. 6 Everything else would be totally meaningless. 7 God's</string>
                    <string>meaning is incomplete without you, and you are incomplete without your creations. 8 Accept your</string>

                    <string>everywhere. 5 You do not have to seek far for salvation. 6 Every minute and every second gives you</string>
                    <string>a chance to save yourself. 7 Do not lose these chances, not because they will not return, but because</string>
                    <string>delay of joy is needless. 8 God wills you perfect happiness now. 9 Is it possible that this is not also</string>

                    <string>disagreement on anything else, but not on this. 3 This, then, is where peace abides. 4 And you abide</string>
                    <string>in peace when you so decide. 5 Yet you cannot abide in peace unless you accept the Atonement,</string>
                    <string>because the Atonement is the way to peace. 6 The reason is very simple, and so obvious that it is</string>
                    <string>often overlooked. 7 The ego is afraid of the obvious, since obviousness is the essential characteristic</string>
                    <string>of reality. 8 Yet you cannot overlook it unless you are not looking.</string>

                    <string>T-9.VII.3. It is perfectly obvious that if the Holy Spirit looks with love on all He perceives, He looks</string>
                    <string>with love on you. 2 His evaluation of you is based on His knowledge of what you are, and so He</string>
                    <string>evaluates you truly. 3 And this evaluation must be in your mind, because He is. 4 The ego is also in</string>
                    <string>your mind, because you have accepted it there. 5 Its evaluation of you, however, is the exact</string>
                    <string>opposite of the Holy Spirit's, because the ego does not love you. 6 It is unaware of what you are,</string>
                    <string>and wholly mistrustful of everything it perceives because its perceptions are so shifting. 7 The ego</string>
                    <string>is therefore capable of suspiciousness at best and viciousness at worst. 8 That is its range. 9 It</string>
                    <string>cannot exceed it because of its uncertainty. 10 And it can never go beyond it because it can never be</string>
                    <string>certain.</string>

                    <string>T-9.VII.4. You, then, have two conflicting evaluations of yourself in your mind, and they cannot</string>
                    <string>both be true. 2 You do not yet realize how completely different these evaluations are, because you</string>
                    <string>do not understand how lofty the Holy Spirit's perception of you really is. 3 He is not deceived by</string>
                    <string>anything you do, because He never forgets what you are. 4 The ego is deceived by everything you</string>
                    <string>do, especially when you respond to the Holy Spirit, because at such times its confusion increases. 5</string>
                    <string>The ego is, therefore, particularly likely to attack you when you react lovingly, because it has</string>
                    <string>evaluated you as unloving and you are going against its judgment. 6 The ego will attack your</string>
                    <string>motives as soon as they become clearly out of accord with its perception of you. 7 This is when it</string>
                    <string>will shift abruptly from suspiciousness to viciousness, since its uncertainty is increased. 8 Yet it is</string>
                    <string>surely pointless to attack in return. 9 What can this mean except that you are agreeing with the ego's</string>
                    <string>evaluation of what you are?</string>

                    <string>yourself and must therefore regard yourself as inadequate. 3 Would you look to the ego to help you</string>
                    <string>escape from a sense of inadequacy it has produced, and must maintain for its existence? 4 Can you</string>
                    <string>escape from its evaluation of you by using its methods for keeping this picture intact?</string>

                    <string>T-9.VII.6. You cannot evaluate an insane belief system from within it. 2 Its range precludes this. 3</string>
                    <string>You can only go beyond it, look back from a point where sanity exists and see the contrast. 4 Only</string>
                    <string>by this contrast can insanity be judged as insane. 5 With the grandeur of God in you, you have</string>
                    <string>chosen to be little and to lament your littleness. 6 Within the system that dictated this choice the</string>
                    <string>lament is inevitable. 7 Your littleness is taken for granted there and you do not ask, "Who granted it?</string>
                    <string>" 8 The question is meaningless within the ego's thought system, because it would open the whole</string>

                    <string>T-9.VII.7. I have said that the ego does not know what a real question is. 2 Lack of knowledge of</string>
                    <string>any kind is always associated with unwillingness to know, and this produces a total lack of</string>
                    <string>knowledge simply because knowledge is total. 3 Not to question your littleness therefore is to deny</string>
                    <string>all knowledge, and keep the ego's whole thought system intact. 4 You cannot retain part of a</string>
                    <string>thought system, because it can be questioned only at its foundation. 5 And this must be questioned</string>
                    <string>from beyond it, because within it its foundation does stand. 6 The Holy Spirit judges against the</string>
                    <string>reality of the ego's thought system merely because He knows its foundation is not true. 7 Therefore,</string>
                    <string>nothing that arises from it means anything. 8 He judges every belief you hold in terms of where it</string>
                    <string>comes from. 9 If it comes from God, He knows it to be true. 10 If it does not, He knows that it is</string>

                    <string>accept nothing that you would not offer to God as wholly fitting for Him. 6 You do not want</string>
                    <string>anything else. 7 Return your part to Him, and He will give you all of Himself in exchange for the</string>

                    <string>T-9.VIII.1. Grandeur is of God, and only of Him. 2 Therefore it is in you. 3 Whenever you become</string>
                    <string>aware of it, however dimly, you abandon the ego automatically, because in the presence of the</string>
                    <string>grandeur of God the meaninglessness of the ego becomes perfectly apparent. 4 When this occurs,</string>
                    <string>even though it does not understand it, the ego believes that its "enemy" has struck, and attempts to</string>
                    <string>offer gifts to induce you to return to its "protection." 5 Self-inflation is the only offering it can</string>
                    <string>make. 6 The grandiosity of the ego is its alternative to the grandeur of God. 7 Which will you</string>

                    <string>T-9.VIII.2. Grandiosity is always a cover for despair. 2 It is without hope because it is not real. 3 It</string>
                    <string>is an attempt to counteract your littleness, based on the belief that the littleness is real. 4 Without</string>
                    <string>this belief grandiosity is meaningless, and you could not possibly want it. 5 The essence of</string>
                    <string>grandiosity is competitiveness, because it always involves attack. 6 It is a delusional attempt to</string>
                    <string>outdo, but not to undo. 7 We said before that the ego vacillates between suspiciousness and</string>
                    <string>viciousness. 8 It remains suspicious as long as you despair of yourself. 9 It shifts to viciousness</string>
                    <string>when you decide not to tolerate self-abasement and seek relief. 10 Then it offers you the illusion of</string>
                    <string>attack as a "solution."</string>

                    <string>T-9.VIII.3. The ego does not understand the difference between grandeur and grandiosity, because it</string>
                    <string>sees no difference between miracle impulses and ego-alien beliefs of its own. 2 I told you that the</string>
                    <string>ego is aware of threat to its existence, but makes no distinctions between these two very different</string>
                    <string>kinds of threat. 3 Its profound sense of vulnerability renders it incapable of judgment except in</string>
                    <string>terms of attack. 4 When the ego experiences threat, its only decision is whether to attack now or to</string>
                    <string>withdraw to attack later. 5 If you accept its offer of grandiosity it will attack immediately. 6 If you</string>
                    <string>do not, it will wait.</string>

                    <string>T-9.VIII.4. The ego is immobilized in the presence of God's grandeur, because His grandeur</string>
                    <string>establishes your freedom. 2 Even the faintest hint of your reality literally drives the ego from your</string>
                    <string>mind, because you will give up all investment in it. 3 Grandeur is totally without illusions, and</string>
                    <string>because it is real it is compellingly convincing. 4 Yet the conviction of reality will not remain with</string>
                    <string>you unless you do not allow the ego to attack it. 5 The ego will make every effort to recover and</string>
                    <string>mobilize its energies against your release. 6 It will tell you that you are insane, and argue that</string>
                    <string>grandeur cannot be a real part of you because of the littleness in which it believes. 7 Yet your</string>
                    <string>grandeur is not delusional because you did not make it. 8 You made grandiosity and are afraid of it</string>
                    <string>because it is a form of attack, but your grandeur is of God, Who created it out of His Love.</string>

                    <string>blessing you hold it in your mind, protecting it from illusions and keeping yourself in the Mind of</string>
                    <string>God. 3 Remember always that you cannot be anywhere except in the Mind of God. 4 When you</string>

                    <string>upon your grandeur you cannot despair, and therefore you cannot want the ego. 3 Your grandeur is</string>
                    <string>God's answer to the ego, because it is true. 4 Littleness and grandeur cannot coexist, nor is it</string>
                    <string>possible for them to alternate. 5 Littleness and grandiosity can and must alternate, since both are</string>
                    <string>untrue and are therefore on the same level. 6 Being the level of shift, it is experienced as shifting</string>

                    <string>something you have made. 4 Perhaps it is the belief in littleness; perhaps it is the belief in</string>
                    <string>grandiosity. 5 Yet it must be insane because it is not true. 6 Your grandeur will never deceive you,</string>
                    <string>but your illusions always will. 7 Illusions are deceptions. 8 You cannot triumph, but you are</string>
                    <string>exalted. 9 And in your exalted state you seek others like you and rejoice with them.</string>

                    <string>Son is one. 6 When I said, "My peace I give unto you," I meant it. 7 Peace comes from God through</string>

                    <string>it is this value that makes you whole. 6 A whole mind is not idolatrous, and does not know of</string>

                    <string>Yet fear is not due them either, for nothing cannot be fearful. 11 You have chosen to fear love</string>

                    <string>6 To be out of control is to be out of reason, and then the mind does become unreasonable. 7 By</string>

                    <string>the laws of God has ever been, and nothing but His Will will ever be. 6 You were created through</string>

                    <string>cannot be in yours, because you are of one mind and that mind belongs to Him. 3 It is yours because</string>
                    <string>it belongs to Him, for to Him ownership is sharing. 4 And if it is so for Him, it is so for you. 5 His</string>
                    <string>definitions are His laws, for by them He established the universe as what it is. 6 No false gods you</string>
                    <string>attempt to interpose between yourself and your reality affect truth at all. 7 Peace is yours because</string>

                    <string>3 It is a call to the Holy Spirit in his mind, a call that is strengthened by joining. 4 Because the</string>

                    <string>sickness, which he does not share. 5 The power of one mind can shine into another, because all the</string>

                    <string>permitted, for depression is the sign of allegiance to him. 3 Depression means that you have</string>
                    <string>forsworn God. 4 Many are afraid of blasphemy, but they do not understand what it means. 5 They</string>
                    <string>do not realize that to deny God is to deny their own Identity, and in this sense the wages of sin is</string>
                    <string>death. 6 The sense is very literal; denial of life perceives its opposite, as all forms of denial replace</string>
                    <string>what is with what is not. 7 No one can really do this, but that you can think you can and believe you</string>

                    <string>believe that others and not yourself have done this to you. 2 You must receive the message you give</string>
                    <string>because it is the message you want. 3 You may believe that you judge your brothers by the</string>
                    <string>messages they give you, but you have judged them by the message you give to them. 4 Do not</string>
                    <string>attribute your denial of joy to them, or you cannot see the spark in them that would bring joy to you.</string>
                    <string>5 It is the denial of the spark that brings depression, for whenever you see your brothers without it,</string>

                    <string>demands the denial of health, because health is in direct opposition to its own survival. 3 But</string>

                    <string>what God's Will is for you, and He will tell you yours. 8 It cannot be too often repeated that you do</string>
                    <string>not know it. 9 Whenever what the Holy Spirit tells you appears to be coercive, it is only because you</string>

                    <string>brings it closer. 3 The Son of God has both Father and Son, because he is both Father and Son. 4 To</string>
                    <string>unite having and being is to unite your will with His, for He wills you Himself. 5 And you will</string>

                    <string>knows nothing. 3 That way is hard indeed, and very lonely. 4 Fear and grief are your guests, and</string>
                    <string>they go with you and abide with you on the way. 5 But the dark journey is not the way of God's</string>
                    <string>Son. 6 Walk in light and do not see the dark companions, for they are not fit companions for the</string>
                    <string>Son of God, who was created of light and in light. 7 The Great Light always surrounds you and</string>
                    <string>shines out from you. 8 How can you see the dark companions in a light such as this? 9 If you see</string>
                    <string>them, it is only because you are denying the light. 10 But deny them instead, for the light is here and</string>
                    <string>the way is clear.</string>

                    <string>him. 3 You will never lose your way, for God leads you. 4 When you wander, you but undertake a</string>
                    <string>journey that is not real. 5 The dark companions, the dark way, are all illusions. 6 Turn toward the</string>
                    <string>light, for the little spark in you is part of a light so great that it can sweep you out of all darkness</string>

                    <string>you. 4 But be holy in the Presence of God, or you will not know that you are there. 5 For what is</string>
                    <string>unlike God cannot enter His Mind, because it was not His Thought and therefore does not belong to</string>
                    <string>Him. 6 And your mind must be as pure as His, if you would know what belongs to you. 7 Guard</string>
                    <string>carefully His temple, for He Himself dwells there and abides in peace. 8 You cannot enter God's</string>
                    <string>Presence with the dark companions beside you, but you also cannot enter alone. 9 All your brothers</string>
                    <string>must enter with you, for until you have accepted them you cannot enter. 10 For you cannot</string>
                    <string>understand wholeness unless you are whole, and no part of the Son can be excluded if he would</string>

                    <string>creation It is yours, and belonging to you It is His. 3 Your Self does not need salvation, but your</string>
                    <string>mind needs to learn what salvation is. 4 You are not saved from anything, but you are saved for</string>
                    <string>glory. 5 Glory is your inheritance, given you by your Creator that you might extend it. 6 Yet if you</string>
                    <string>hate part of your Self all your understanding is lost, because you are looking on what God created as</string>
                    <string>yourself without love. 7 And since what He created is part of Him, you are denying Him His place</string>

                    <string>deny the Father without believing that the Father has denied him? 3 God's laws hold only for your</string>
                    <string>protection, and they never hold in vain. 4 What you experience when you deny your Father is still</string>
                    <string>for your protection, for the power of your will cannot be lessened without the intervention of God</string>
                    <string>against it, and any limitation on your power is not the Will of God. 5 Therefore, look only to the</string>
                    <string>power that God gave to save you, remembering that it is yours because it is His, and join with your</string>

                    <string>unknown to you. 3 Every altar to God is part of you, because the light He created is one with Him. 4</string>
                    <string>Would you cut off a brother from the light that is yours? 5 You would not do so if you realized that</string>
                    <string>you can darken only your own mind. 6 As you bring him back, so will you return. 7 That is the law</string>

                    <string>the beginning of the dawn of light. 3 Remember also that the denial of this simple fact takes many</string>
                    <string>forms, and these you must learn to recognize and to oppose steadfastly, without exception. 4 This is</string>
                    <string>a crucial step in the reawakening. 5 The beginning phases of this reversal are often quite painful, for</string>
                    <string>as blame is withdrawn from without, there is a strong tendency to harbor it within. 6 It is difficult at</string>
                    <string>first to realize that this is exactly the same thing, for there is no distinction between within and</string>

                    <string>blaming yourself. 2 And you cannot blame yourself without blaming them. 3 That is why blame</string>
                    <string>must be undone, not seen elsewhere. 4 Lay it to yourself and you cannot know yourself, for only the</string>
                    <string>ego blames at all. 5 Self-blame is therefore ego identification, and as much an ego defense as</string>
                    <string>blaming others. 6 You cannot enter God's Presence if you attack His Son. 7 When His Son lifts his</string>
                    <string>voice in praise of his Creator, he will hear the Voice for his Father. 8 Yet the Creator cannot be</string>
                    <string>praised without His Son, for Their glory is shared and They are glorified together.</string>

                    <string>waits for your acceptance of Him as yourself, and of His Wholeness as yours. 4 For Christ is the</string>
                    <string>Son of God, Who lives in His Creator and shines with His glory. 5 Christ is the extension of the</string>

                    <string>ready to look more closely at the ego's thought system because together we have the lamp that will</string>
                    <string>dispel it, and since you realize you do not want it, you must be ready. 4 Let us be very calm in</string>
                    <string>doing this, for we are merely looking honestly for truth. 5 The "dynamics" of the ego will be our</string>
                    <string>lesson for a while, for we must look first at this to see beyond it, since you have made it real. 6 We</string>

                    <string>else can one dispel illusions except by looking at them directly, without protecting them? 3 Be not</string>
                    <string>afraid, therefore, for what you will be looking at is the source of fear, and you are beginning to learn</string>
                    <string>that fear is not real. 4 You are also learning that its effects can be dispelled merely by denying their</string>
                    <string>reality. 5 The next step is obviously to recognize that what has no effects does not exist. 6 Laws do</string>
                    <string>not operate in a vacuum, and what leads to nothing has not happened. 7 If reality is recognized by</string>
                    <string>its extension, what leads to nothing could not be real. 8 Do not be afraid, then, to look upon fear, for</string>
                    <string>it cannot be seen. 9 Clarity undoes confusion by definition, and to look upon darkness through light</string>

                    <string>mean anything. 2 It contains the very contradiction in terms that makes it meaningless. 3</string>
                    <string>"Dynamics" implies the power to do something, and the whole separation fallacy lies in the belief</string>
                    <string>that the ego has the power to do anything. 4 The ego is fearful to you because you believe this. 5</string>
                    <string>Yet the truth is very simple: 6 All power is of God. 7 What is not of Him has no power to do</string>

                    <string>can surely regard a delusional system without fear, for it cannot have any effects if its source is not</string>
                    <string>real. 3 Fear becomes more obviously inappropriate if you recognize the ego's goal, which is so</string>
                    <string>clearly senseless that any effort on its behalf is necessarily expended on nothing. 4 The ego's goal is</string>
                    <string>quite explicitly ego autonomy. 5 From the beginning, then, its purpose is to be separate, sufficient</string>
                    <string>unto itself and independent of any power except its own. 6 This is why it is the symbol of</string>

                    <string>Will is One because the extension of His Will cannot be unlike itself. 5 The real conflict you</string>
                    <string>experience, then, is between the ego's idle wishes and the Will of God, which you share. 6 Can this</string>

                    <string>lies in your complete dependence on God, Whose function He shares with you. 3 By His willingness</string>
                    <string>to share it, He became as dependent on you as you are on Him. 4 Do not ascribe the ego's arrogance</string>
                    <string>to Him Who wills not to be independent of you. 5 He has included you in His Autonomy. 6 Can</string>
                    <string>you believe that autonomy is meaningful apart from Him? 7 The belief in ego autonomy is costing</string>
                    <string>you the knowledge of your dependence on God, in which your freedom lies. 8 The ego sees all</string>
                    <string>dependency as threatening, and has twisted even your longing for God into a means of establishing</string>

                    <string>does nothing else, because its goal of autonomy is nothing else. 3 The ego is totally confused about</string>
                    <string>reality, but it does not lose sight of its goal. 4 It is much more vigilant than you are, because it is</string>
                    <string>perfectly certain of its purpose. 5 You are confused because you do not recognize yours.</string>

                    <string>of it. 2 For if the ego could give rise to fear, it would diminish your independence and weaken your</string>
                    <string>power. 3 Yet its one claim to your allegiance is that it can give power to you. 4 Without this belief</string>
                    <string>you would not listen to it at all. 5 How, then, can its existence continue if you realize that, by</string>
                    <string>accepting it, you are belittling yourself and depriving yourself of power?</string>

                    <string>afraid. 2 Minimizing fear, but not its undoing, is the ego's constant effort, and is indeed a skill at</string>
                    <string>which it is very ingenious. 3 How can it preach separation without upholding it through fear, and</string>

                    <string>of the form it takes and quite apart from how the ego wants you to experience it, is therefore the</string>
                    <string>basic ego threat. 2 Its dream of autonomy is shaken to its foundation by this awareness. 3 For</string>
                    <string>though you may countenance a false idea of independence, you will not accept the cost of fear if you</string>
                    <string>recognize it. 4 Yet this is the cost, and the ego cannot minimize it. 5 If you overlook love you are</string>
                    <string>overlooking yourself, and you must fear unreality because you have denied yourself. 6 By believing</string>
                    <string>that you have successfully attacked truth, you are believing that attack has power. 7 Very simply,</string>
                    <string>then, you have become afraid of yourself. 8 And no one wants to find what he believes would</string>

                    <string>yours, and is therefore incomplete without it. 2 You can only establish your autonomy by identifying</string>
                    <string>with Him, and fulfilling your function as it exists in truth. 3 The ego believes that to accomplish its</string>
                    <string>goal is happiness. 4 But it is given you to know that God's function is yours, and happiness cannot</string>
                    <string>be found apart from Your joint Will. 5 Recognize only that the ego's goal, which you have pursued</string>
                    <string>so diligently, has merely brought you fear, and it becomes difficult to maintain that fear is</string>
                    <string>happiness. 6 Upheld by fear, this is what the ego would have you believe. 7 Yet God's Son is not</string>

                    <string>insane would choose fear in place of love, and only the insane could believe that love can be gained</string>
                    <string>by attack. 10 But the sane realize that only attack could produce fear, from which the Love of God</string>

                    <string>through acceptance, for to analyze means to break down or to separate out. 3 The attempt to</string>

                    <string>ego to everything. 4 The ego believes that power, understanding and truth lie in separation, and to</string>
                    <string>establish this belief it must attack. 5 Unaware that the belief cannot be established, and obsessed</string>
                    <string>with the conviction that separation is salvation, the ego attacks everything it perceives by breaking it</string>
                    <string>into small, disconnected parts, without meaningful relationships and therefore without meaning. 6</string>
                    <string>The ego will always substitute chaos for meaning, for if separation is salvation, harmony is threat.</string>

                    <string>opposite of the Holy Spirit's. 2 The ego focuses on error and overlooks truth. 3 It makes real every</string>
                    <string>mistake it perceives, and with characteristically circular reasoning concludes that because of the</string>
                    <string>mistake consistent truth must be meaningless. 4 The next step, then, is obvious. 5 If consistent truth</string>
                    <string>is meaningless, inconsistency must be true. 6 Holding error clearly in mind, and protecting what it</string>
                    <string>has made real, the ego proceeds to the next step in its thought system: Error is real and truth is error.</string>

                    <string>which it unifies on behalf of itself. 3 This, then, becomes the universe it perceives. 4 And it is this</string>

                    <string>insanity is strong to the insane. 4 For reasoning ends at its beginning, and no thought system</string>
                    <string>transcends its source. 5 Yet reasoning without meaning cannot demonstrate anything, and those who</string>
                    <string>are convinced by it must be deluded. 6 Can the ego teach truly when it overlooks truth? 7 Can it</string>
                    <string>perceive what it has denied? 8 Its witnesses do attest to its denial, but hardly to what it has denied. 9</string>

                    <string>there must be another world that you do not see. 4 The Bible speaks of a new Heaven and a new</string>
                    <string>earth, yet this cannot be literally true, for the eternal are not re-created. 5 To perceive anew is</string>
                    <string>merely to perceive again, implying that before, or in the interval between, you were not perceiving</string>

                    <string>they are like the Father, and therefore cannot die. 6 The real world can actually be perceived. 7 All</string>
                    <string>that is necessary is a willingness to perceive nothing else. 8 For if you perceive both good and evil,</string>
                    <string>you are accepting both the false and the true and making no distinction between them.</string>

                    <string>something that is not real to the real, thus confusing illusion and reality. 5 For perceptions cannot be</string>

                    <string>condition of knowledge. 3 Without this awareness you have not met its conditions, and until you do</string>
                    <string>you will not know it is yours already. 4 You have made many ideas that you have placed between</string>
                    <string>yourself and your Creator, and these beliefs are the world as you perceive it. 5 Truth is not absent</string>
                    <string>here, but it is obscure. 6 You do not know the difference between what you have made and what</string>

                    <string>have created. 10 7 To believe that you can perceive the real world is to believe that you can know</string>
                    <string>yourself. 8 You can know God because it is His Will to be known. 9 The real world is all that the</string>

                    <string>Everything else is an appeal for healing and help, regardless of the form it takes. 5 Can anyone be</string>

                    <string>consistently, you will gain an increasing awareness that His criteria are equally applicable to you. 2</string>
                    <string>For to recognize fear is not enough to escape from it, although the recognition is necessary to</string>
                    <string>demonstrate the need for escape. 3 The Holy Spirit must still translate the fear into truth. 4 If you</string>
                    <string>were left with the fear, once you had recognized it, you would have taken a step away from reality,</string>
                    <string>not towards it. 5 Yet we have repeatedly emphasized the need to recognize fear and face it without</string>
                    <string>disguise as a crucial step in the undoing of the ego. 6 Consider how well the Holy Spirit's</string>
                    <string>interpretation of the motives of others will serve you then. 7 Having taught you to accept only</string>
                    <string>loving thoughts in others and to regard everything else as an appeal for help, He has taught you that</string>
                    <string>fear itself is an appeal for help. 8 This is what recognizing fear really means. 9 If you do not protect</string>
                    <string>it, He will reinterpret it. 10 That is the ultimate value in learning to perceive attack as a call for love.</string>
                    <string>11 We have already learned that fear and attack are inevitably associated. 12 If only attack produces</string>
                    <string>fear, and if you see attack as the call for help that it is, the unreality of fear must dawn on you. 13</string>
                    <string>For fear is a call for love, in unconscious recognition of what has been denied.</string>

                    <string>T-12.I.9. Fear is a symptom of your own deep sense of loss. 2 If when you perceive it in others you</string>
                    <string>learn to supply the loss, the basic cause of fear is removed. 3 Thereby you teach yourself that fear</string>
                    <string>does not exist in you. 4 The means for removing it is in yourself, and you have demonstrated this by</string>
                    <string>giving it. 5 Fear and love are the only emotions of which you are capable. 6 One is false, for it was</string>
                    <string>made out of denial; and denial depends on the belief in what is denied for its own existence. 7 By</string>
                    <string>interpreting fear correctly as a positive affirmation of the underlying belief it masks, you are</string>
                    <string>undermining its perceived usefulness by rendering it useless. 8 Defenses that do not work at all are</string>
                    <string>automatically discarded. 9 If you raise what fear conceals to clear-cut unequivocal predominance,</string>
                    <string>fear becomes meaningless. 10 You have denied its power to conceal love, which was its only</string>
                    <string>purpose. 11 The veil that you have drawn across the face of love has disappeared.</string>

                    <string>of fear does dispel it, for the awareness of truth cannot be denied. 4 Thus does the Holy Spirit</string>
                    <string>replace fear with love and translate error into truth. 5 And thus will you learn of Him how to replace</string>
                    <string>your dream of separation with the fact of unity. 6 For the separation is only the denial of union, and</string>

                    <string>oneself, those who are sick do not love themselves. 3 Therefore, they are asking for the love that</string>

                    <string>themselves they could not be sick. 5 The task of the miracle worker thus becomes to deny the denial</string>
                    <string>of truth. 6 The sick must heal themselves, for the truth is in them. 7 Yet having obscured it, the light</string>

                    <string>them because they do not understand them. 2 If they ask for enlightenment and accept it, their fears</string>
                    <string>vanish. 3 But if they hide their nightmares they will keep them. 4 It is easy to help an uncertain</string>
                    <string>child, for he recognizes that he does not understand what his perceptions mean. 5 Yet you believe</string>
                    <string>that you do understand yours. 6 Little child, you are hiding your head under the cover of the heavy</string>
                    <string>blankets you have laid upon yourself. 7 You are hiding your nightmares in the darkness of your own</string>

                    <string>will frighten you, for the reality of nothingness cannot be frightening. 4 Let us not delay this, for</string>
                    <string>your dream of hatred will not leave you without help, and Help is here. 5 Learn to be quiet in the</string>
                    <string>midst of turmoil, for quietness is the end of strife and this is the journey to peace. 6 Look straight at</string>
                    <string>every image that rises to delay you, for the goal is inevitable because it is eternal. 7 The goal of love</string>

                    <string>by denying its full import in any way--this is what you will really see. 6 You cannot lay aside the</string>
                    <string>obstacles to real vision without looking upon them, for to lay aside means to judge against. 7 If you</string>
                    <string>will look, the Holy Spirit will judge, and He will judge truly. 8 Yet He cannot shine away what you</string>

                    <string>T-12.III.1. I once asked you to sell all you have and give to the poor and follow me. 2 This is what I</string>
                    <string>meant: If you have no investment in anything in this world, you can teach the poor where their</string>
                    <string>treasure is. 3 The poor are merely those who have invested wrongly, and they are poor indeed! 4</string>
                    <string>Because they are in need it is given you to help them, since you are among them. 5 Consider how</string>
                    <string>perfectly your lesson would be learned if you were unwilling to share their poverty. 6 For poverty is</string>
                    <string>lack, and there is but one lack since there is but one need.</string>

                    <string>His very insistence should tell you that he believes salvation lies in it. 3 If you insist on refusing and</string>
                    <string>experience a quick response of opposition, you are believing that your salvation lies in not doing it.</string>
                    <string>4 You, then, are making the same mistake he is, and are making his error real to both of you. 5</string>
                    <string>Insistence means investment, and what you invest in is always related to your notion of salvation. 6</string>
                    <string>The question is always twofold; first, what is to be saved? 7 And second, how can it be saved?</string>

                    <string>the ego is to be saved, and to be saved by attack. 2 If he attacks, you are agreeing with this belief;</string>
                    <string>and if you attack, you are reinforcing it. 3 Remember that those who attack are poor. 4 Their</string>
                    <string>poverty asks for gifts, not for further impoverishment. 5 You who could help them are surely acting</string>
                    <string>destructively if you accept their poverty as yours. 6 If you had not invested as they had, it would</string>
                    <string>never occur to you to overlook their need.</string>

                    <string>"outrageous," do it because it does not matter. 2 Refuse, and your opposition establishes that it does</string>
                    <string>matter to you. 3 It is only you, therefore, who have made the request outrageous, and every request</string>
                    <string>of a brother is for you. 4 Why would you insist in denying him? 5 For to do so is to deny yourself</string>
                    <string>and impoverish both. 6 He is asking for salvation, as you are. 7 Poverty is of the ego, and never of</string>
                    <string>God. 8 No "outrageous" requests can be made of one who recognizes what is valuable and wants to</string>

                    <string>can be saved and the only way to save it. 3 Any response other than love arises from a confusion</string>
                    <string>about the "what" and the "how" of salvation, and this is the only answer. 4 Never lose sight of this,</string>
                    <string>and never allow yourself to believe, even for an instant, that there is another answer. 5 For you will</string>
                    <string>surely place yourself among the poor, who do not understand that they dwell in abundance and that</string>

                    <string>anger, because what he did was to exchange Self-love for self-hate, making him afraid of himself. 4</string>
                    <string>He does not realize this. 5 Even if he is fully aware of anxiety he does not perceive its source as his</string>
                    <string>own ego identification, and he always tries to handle it by making some sort of insane</string>
                    <string>"arrangement" with the world. 6 He always perceives this world as outside himself, for this is</string>
                    <string>crucial to his adjustment. 7 He does not realize that he makes this world, for there is no world</string>

                    <string>his mind. 2 His insane thoughts, too, must be in his mind, but an internal conflict of this magnitude</string>
                    <string>he cannot tolerate. 3 A split mind is endangered, and the recognition that it encompasses completely</string>
                    <string>opposed thoughts within itself is intolerable. 4 Therefore the mind projects the split, not the reality.</string>
                    <string>5 Everything you perceive as the outside world is merely your attempt to maintain your ego</string>
                    <string>identification, for everyone believes that identification is salvation. 6 Yet consider what has</string>
                    <string>happened, for thoughts do have consequences to the thinker. 7 You have become at odds with the</string>
                    <string>world as you perceive it, because you think it is antagonistic to you. 8 This is a necessary</string>
                    <string>consequence of what you have done. 9 You have projected outward what is antagonistic to what is</string>
                    <string>inward, and therefore you would have to perceive it this way. 10 That is why you must realize that</string>
                    <string>your hatred is in your mind and not outside it before you can get rid of it; and why you must get rid</string>

                    <string>will against Him, and that is why you have no control over the world you made. 5 It is not a world</string>
                    <string>of will because it is governed by the desire to be unlike God, and this desire is not will. 6 The world</string>
                    <string>you made is therefore totally chaotic, governed by arbitrary and senseless "laws," and without</string>
                    <string>meaning of any kind. 7 For it is made out of what you do not want, projected from your mind</string>

                    <string>perceived self-defeat. 3 For the ego cannot love, and in its frantic search for love it is seeking what</string>
                    <string>it is afraid to find. 4 The search is inevitable because the ego is part of your mind, and because of its</string>
                    <string>source the ego is not wholly split off, or it could not be believed at all. 5 For it is your mind that</string>
                    <string>believes in it and gives existence to it. 6 Yet it is also your mind that has the power to deny the ego's</string>
                    <string>existence, and you will surely do so when you realize exactly what the journey is on which the ego</string>

                    <string>unable to love, the ego would be totally inadequate in love's presence, for it could not respond at all.</string>
                    <string>3 Then, you would have to abandon the ego's guidance, for it would be quite apparent that it had not</string>
                    <string>taught you the response you need. 4 The ego will therefore distort love, and teach you that love</string>
                    <string>really calls forth the responses the ego can teach. 5 Follow its teaching, then, and you will search</string>
                    <string>for love, but will not recognize it.</string>

                    <string>need to do so. 3 Before the idea of attack can enter your mind, you must have perceived yourself as</string>
                    <string>weak. 4 Because you attacked yourself and believed that the attack was effective, you behold</string>
                    <string>yourself as weakened. 5 No longer perceiving yourself and your brothers as equal, and regarding</string>
                    <string>yourself as weaker, you attempt to "equalize" the situation you made. 6 You use attack to do so</string>
                    <string>because you believe that attack was successful in weakening you.</string>

                    <string>of your sanity. 2 For if you accept your invulnerability, you are recognizing that attack has no effect.</string>
                    <string>3 Although you have attacked yourself, you will be demonstrating that nothing really happened. 4</string>
                    <string>Therefore, by attacking you have not done anything. 5 Once you realize this you will no longer see</string>
                    <string>any sense in attack, for it manifestly does not work and cannot protect you. 6 Yet the recognition of</string>
                    <string>your invulnerability has more than negative value. 7 If your attacks on yourself have failed to</string>
                    <string>weaken you, you are still strong. 8 You therefore have no need to "equalize" the situation to</string>
                    <string>establish your strength.</string>

                    <string>trying to attack them you will be unable to avoid interpreting this as reinforcement. 3 The only place</string>
                    <string>you can cancel out all reinforcement is in yourself. 4 For you are always the first point of your</string>

                    <string>because a split mind has made itself a poor learner. 4 You tried to make the separation eternal,</string>
                    <string>because you wanted to retain the characteristics of creation, but with your own content. 5 Yet</string>

                    <string>a Teacher Who can transcend your limited resources. 3 He becomes your Resource because of</string>
                    <string>yourself you cannot learn. 4 The learning situation in which you placed yourself is impossible, and</string>
                    <string>in this situation you clearly require a special Teacher and a special curriculum. 5 Poor learners are</string>
                    <string>not good choices as teachers, either for themselves or for anyone else. 6 You would hardly turn to</string>
                    <string>them to establish the curriculum by which they can escape from their limitations. 7 If they</string>

                    <string>this means, "Try to learn but do not succeed." 3 The result of this curriculum goal is obvious. 4</string>
                    <string>Every legitimate teaching aid, every real instruction, and every sensible guide to learning will be</string>

                    <string>you are trying to learn how not to learn, and the aim of your teaching is to defeat itself, what can</string>
                    <string>you expect but confusion? 6 Such a curriculum does not make sense. 7 This attempt at "learning"</string>
                    <string>has so weakened your mind that you cannot love, for the curriculum you have chosen is against</string>
                    <string>love, and amounts to a course in how to attack yourself. 8 A supplementary goal in this curriculum</string>
                    <string>is learning how not to overcome the split that makes its primary aim believable. 9 And you will not</string>
                    <string>overcome the split in this curriculum, for all your learning will be on its behalf. 10 Yet your mind</string>
                    <string>speaks against your learning as your learning speaks against your mind, and so you fight against all</string>
                    <string>learning and succeed, for that is what you want. 11 But perhaps you do not realize, even yet, that</string>

                    <string>seen, for He has never lost sight of you. 6 He looks quietly on the real world, which He would share</string>
                    <string>with you because He knows of the Father's Love for Him. 7 And knowing this, He would give you</string>

                    <string>encompasses all of it. 5 He has remembered you because He forgot not the Father. 6 You looked</string>
                    <string>upon the unreal and found despair. 7 Yet by seeking the unreal, what else could you find? 8 The</string>
                    <string>unreal world is a thing of despair, for it can never be. 9 And you who share God's Being with Him</string>
                    <string>could never be content without reality. 10 What God did not give you has no power over you, and</string>
                    <string>the attraction of love for love remains irresistible. 11 For it is the function of love to unite all things</string>

                    <string>remember that it was always so. 5 Nothingness will become invisible, for you will at last have seen</string>
                    <string>truly. 6 Redeemed perception is easily translated into knowledge, for only perception is capable of</string>

                    <string>to relinquish denial, but to hold on to it. 7 For it is guilt that has obscured the Father to you, and it is</string>

                    <string>as the acceptance of the Atonement is its end. 2 The world you see is the delusional system of those</string>
                    <string>made mad by guilt. 3 Look carefully at this world, and you will realize that this is so. 4 For this</string>
                    <string>world is the symbol of punishment, and all the laws that seem to govern it are the laws of death. 5</string>
                    <string>Children are born into it through pain and in pain. 6 Their growth is attended by suffering, and they</string>

                    <string>They appear to lose what they love, perhaps the most insane belief of all. 10 And their bodies wither</string>
                    <string>and gasp and are laid in the ground, and are no more. 11 Not one of them but has thought that God</string>

                    <string>would be salvation, and this is the ego's interpretation, not God's. 5 Only the world of guilt could</string>
                    <string>demand this, for only the guilty could conceive of it. 6 Adam's "sin" could have touched no one, had</string>
                    <string>he not believed it was the Father Who drove him out of Paradise. 7 For in that belief the knowledge</string>

                    <string>only this, for sharing the Father's Love for His Son, He seeks to remove all guilt from his mind that</string>
                    <string>he may remember his Father in peace. 3 Peace and guilt are antithetical, and the Father can be</string>
                    <string>remembered only in peace. 4 Love and guilt cannot coexist, and to accept one is to deny the other. 5</string>
                    <string>Guilt hides Christ from your sight, for it is the denial of the blamelessness of God's Son.</string>

                    <string>you accepted, and you hold it dear. 4 For the blamelessness of Christ is the proof that the ego never</string>

                    <string>3 The retaliation that he fears and that he sees will never touch him, for although he believes in it</string>

                    <string>idea of guilt brings a belief in condemnation of one by another, projecting separation in place of</string>
                    <string>unity. 4 You can condemn only yourself, and by so doing you cannot know that you are God's Son.</string>
                    <string>5 You have denied the condition of his being, which is his perfect blamelessness. 6 Out of love he</string>
                    <string>was created, and in love he abides. 7 Goodness and mercy have always followed him, for he has</string>

                    <string>holiness of God's Son shine away the cloud of guilt that darkens your mind, and by accepting his</string>

                    <string>guilt. 3 For guilt establishes that you will be punished for what you have done, and thus depends on</string>
                    <string>one-dimensional time, proceeding from past to future. 4 No one who believes this can understand</string>
                    <string>what "always" means, and therefore guilt must deprive you of the appreciation of eternity. 5 You are</string>
                    <string>immortal because you are eternal, and "always" must be now. 6 Guilt, then, is a way of holding past</string>
                    <string>and future in your mind to ensure the ego's continuity. 7 For if what has been will be punished, the</string>
                    <string>ego's continuity is guaranteed. 8 Yet the guarantee of your continuity is God's, not the ego's. 9 And</string>
                    <string>immortality is the opposite of time, for time passes away, while immortality is constant.</string>

                    <string>The future, in time, is always associated with expiation, and only guilt could induce a sense of a</string>
                    <string>need for expiation. 3 Accepting the guiltlessness of the Son of God as yours is therefore God's way</string>
                    <string>of reminding you of His Son, and what he is in truth. 4 For God has never condemned His Son, and</string>
                    <string>being guiltless he is eternal.</string>

                    <string>it simply through the calm recognition that it has never been. 5 As He looks upon the guiltless Son</string>
                    <string>of God, He knows that this is true. 6 And being true for you, you cannot attack yourself, for without</string>
                    <string>guilt attack is impossible. 7 You, then, are saved because God's Son is guiltless. 8 And being wholly</string>

                    <string>the ego attempts to get rid of guilt from its viewpoint only, for much as the ego wants to retain guilt</string>
                    <string>you find it intolerable, since guilt stands in the way of your remembering God, Whose pull is so</string>
                    <string>strong that you cannot resist it. 3 On this issue, then, the deepest split of all occurs, for if you are to</string>
                    <string>retain guilt, as the ego insists, you cannot be you. 4 Only by persuading you that it is you could the</string>
                    <string>ego possibly induce you to project guilt, and thereby keep it in your mind.</string>

                    <string>idea why. 4 On the contrary, you associate it with a weird assortment of "ego ideals," which the ego</string>

                    <string>him to death. 3 You do not even suspect this murderous but insane idea lies hidden there, for the</string>
                    <string>ego's destructive urge is so intense that nothing short of the crucifixion of God's Son can ultimately</string>
                    <string>satisfy it. 4 It does not know who the Son of God is because it is blind. 5 Yet let it perceive</string>

                    <string>the ego, the guiltless are guilty. 3 Those who do not attack are its "enemies" because, by not valuing</string>
                    <string>its interpretation of salvation, they are in an excellent position to let it go. 4 They have approached</string>
                    <string>the darkest and deepest cornerstone in the ego's foundation, and while the ego can withstand your</string>
                    <string>raising all else to question, it guards this one secret with its life, for its existence depends on</string>
                    <string>keeping this secret. 5 So it is this secret that we must look upon, for the ego cannot protect you</string>

                    <string>have not uncovered its source. 6 For the ego does want to kill you, and if you identify with it you</string>

                    <string>guiltlessness is blasphemous to God. 3 To the ego, the ego is God, and guiltlessness must be</string>
                    <string>interpreted as the final guilt that fully justifies murder. 4 You do not yet understand that any fear</string>

                    <string>course on love, because it is about you. 3 You have been told that your function in this world is</string>
                    <string>healing, and your function in Heaven is creating. 4 The ego teaches that your function on earth is</string>
                    <string>destruction, and you have no function at all in Heaven. 5 It would thus destroy you here and bury</string>
                    <string>you here, leaving you no inheritance except the dust out of which it thinks you were made. 6 As</string>
                    <string>long as it is reasonably satisfied with you, as its reasoning goes, it offers you oblivion. 7 When it</string>
                    <string>becomes overtly savage, it offers you hell.</string>

                    <string>Heaven is hell and oblivion, and the real Heaven is the greatest threat you think you could</string>
                    <string>experience. 3 For hell and oblivion are ideas that you made up, and you are bent on demonstrating</string>
                    <string>their reality to establish yours. 4 If their reality is questioned, you believe that yours is. 5 For you</string>
                    <string>believe that attack is your reality, and that your destruction is the final proof that you were right.</string>

                    <string>from the fact that you were wrong? 2 While it could perhaps be argued that death suggests there was</string>
                    <string>life, no one would claim that it proves there is life. 3 Even the past life that death might indicate,</string>
                    <string>could only have been futile if it must come to this, and needs this to prove that it was at all. 4 You</string>
                    <string>question Heaven, but you do not question this. 5 Yet you could heal and be healed if you did</string>
                    <string>question it. 6 And even though you know not Heaven, might it not be more desirable than death? 7</string>
                    <string>You have been as selective in your questioning as in your perception. 8 An open mind is more</string>

                    <string>T-13.IV.4. The ego has a strange notion of time, and it is with this notion that your questioning</string>
                    <string>might well begin. 2 The ego invests heavily in the past, and in the end believes that the past is the</string>
                    <string>only aspect of time that is meaningful. 3 Remember that its emphasis on guilt enables it to ensure its</string>
                    <string>continuity by making the future like the past, and thus avoiding the present. 4 By the notion of</string>
                    <string>paying for the past in the future, the past becomes the determiner of the future, making them</string>
                    <string>continuous without an intervening present. 5 For the ego regards the present only as a brief</string>
                    <string>transition to the future, in which it brings the past to the future by interpreting the present in past</string>
                    <string>terms.</string>

                    <string>T-13.IV.5. "Now" has no meaning to the ego. 2 The present merely reminds it of past hurts, and it</string>
                    <string>reacts to the present as if it were the past. 3 The ego cannot tolerate release from the past, and</string>
                    <string>although the past is over, the ego tries to preserve its image by responding as if it were present. 4 It</string>
                    <string>dictates your reactions to those you meet in the present from a past reference point, obscuring their</string>
                    <string>present reality. 5 In effect, if you follow the ego's dictates you will react to your brother as though</string>
                    <string>he were someone else, and this will surely prevent you from recognizing him as he is. 6 And you</string>
                    <string>will receive messages from him out of your own past because, by making it real in the present, you</string>
                    <string>are forbidding yourself to let it go. 7 You thus deny yourself the message of release that every</string>
                    <string>brother offers you now.</string>

                    <string>T-13.IV.6. The shadowy figures from the past are precisely what you must escape. 2 They are not</string>
                    <string>real, and have no hold over you unless you bring them with you. 3 They carry the spots of pain in</string>
                    <string>your mind, directing you to attack in the present in retaliation for a past that is no more. 4 And this</string>
                    <string>decision is one of future pain. 5 Unless you learn that past pain is an illusion, you are choosing a</string>
                    <string>future of illusions and losing the many opportunities you could find for release in the present. 6 The</string>
                    <string>ego would preserve your nightmares, and prevent you from awakening and understanding they are</string>
                    <string>past. 7 Would you recognize a holy encounter if you are merely perceiving it as a meeting with your</string>
                    <string>own past? 8 For you would be meeting no one, and the sharing of salvation, which makes the</string>
                    <string>encounter holy, would be excluded from your sight. 9 The Holy Spirit teaches that you always meet</string>
                    <string>yourself, and the encounter is holy because you are. 10 The ego teaches that you always encounter</string>
                    <string>your past, and because your dreams were not holy, the future cannot be, and the present is without</string>
                    <string>meaning.</string>

                    <string>T-13.IV.7. It is evident that the Holy Spirit's perception of time is the exact opposite of the ego's. 2</string>
                    <string>The reason is equally clear, for they perceive the goal of time as diametrically opposed. 3 The Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit interprets time's purpose as rendering the need for time unnecessary. 4 He regards the</string>
                    <string>function of time as temporary, serving only His teaching function, which is temporary by definition.</string>
                    <string>5 His emphasis is therefore on the only aspect of time that can extend to the infinite, for now is the</string>
                    <string>closest approximation of eternity that this world offers. 6 It is in the reality of "now," without past or</string>
                    <string>future, that the beginning of the appreciation of eternity lies. 7 For only "now" is here, and only</string>
                    <string>"now" presents the opportunities for the holy encounters in which salvation can be found.</string>

                    <string>T-13.IV.8. The ego, on the other hand, regards the function of time as one of extending itself in</string>
                    <string>place of eternity, for like the Holy Spirit, the ego interprets the goal of time as its own. 2 The</string>
                    <string>continuity of past and future, under its direction, is the only purpose the ego perceives in time, and</string>
                    <string>it closes over the present so that no gap in its own continuity can occur. 3 Its continuity, then, would</string>
                    <string>keep you in time, while the Holy Spirit would release you from it. 4 It is His interpretation of the</string>
                    <string>means of salvation that you must learn to accept, if you would share His goal of salvation for you.</string>

                    <string>function in the world of time as one of healing, you will emphasize only the aspect of time in which</string>
                    <string>healing can occur. 3 Healing cannot be accomplished in the past. 4 It must be accomplished in the</string>
                    <string>present to release the future. 5 This interpretation ties the future to the present, and extends the</string>
                    <string>present rather than the past. 6 But if you interpret your function as destruction, you will lose sight of</string>
                    <string>the present and hold on to the past to ensure a destructive future. 7 And time will be as you interpret</string>
                    <string>it, for of itself it is nothing.</string>

                    <string>so you cannot see it. 5 Your past reactions to him are also not there, and if it is to them that you</string>
                    <string>react, you see but an image of him that you made and cherish instead of him. 6 In your questioning</string>
                    <string>of illusions, ask yourself if it is really sane to perceive what was as now. 7 If you remember the past</string>

                    <string>unless you are afraid of light. 5 And only if you are would you choose to bring darkness with you,</string>

                    <string>even from the very hands that grasped it, it will be wrenched and hurled into the dust. 4 For where</string>

                    <string>temporary, and will but last until you step aside from all your needs and realize that all of them have</string>
                    <string>been fulfilled. 7 Therefore He has no investment in the things that He supplies, except to make</string>
                    <string>certain that you will not use them on behalf of lingering in time. 8 He knows that you are not at</string>

                    <string>in glad exchange for all the world has offered but to take away. 10 And we will spread it like a veil</string>
                    <string>of light across the world's sad face, in which we hide our brothers from the world, and it from them.</string>

                    <string>He teaches that the past does not exist, a fact which belongs to the sphere of knowledge, and which</string>
                    <string>therefore no one in the world can know. 4 It would indeed be impossible to be in the world with this</string>
                    <string>knowledge. 5 For the mind that knows this unequivocally knows also it dwells in eternity, and</string>
                    <string>utilizes no perception at all. 6 It therefore does not consider where it is, because the concept "where"</string>
                    <string>does not mean anything to it. 7 It knows that it is everywhere, just as it has everything, and forever.</string>

                    <string>you consider this: There is nothing partial about knowledge. 2 Every aspect is whole, and therefore</string>
                    <string>no aspect is separate. 3 You are an aspect of knowledge, being in the Mind of God, Who knows</string>
                    <string>you. 4 All knowledge must be yours, for in you is all knowledge. 5 Perception, at its loftiest, is</string>
                    <string>never complete. 6 Even the perception of the Holy Spirit, as perfect as perception can be, is without</string>
                    <string>meaning in Heaven. 7 Perception can reach everywhere under His guidance, for the vision of Christ</string>
                    <string>beholds everything in light. 8 Yet no perception, however holy, will last forever.</string>

                    <string>transfer to it possible. 2 Yet the last step must be taken by God, because the last step in your</string>
                    <string>redemption, which seems to be in the future, was accomplished by God in your creation. 3 The</string>
                    <string>separation has not interrupted it. 4 Creation cannot be interrupted. 5 The separation is merely a</string>
                    <string>faulty formulation of reality, with no effect at all. 6 The miracle, without a function in Heaven, is</string>
                    <string>needful here. 7 Aspects of reality can still be seen, and they will replace aspects of unreality. 8</string>
                    <string>Aspects of reality can be seen in everything and everywhere. 9 Yet only God can gather them</string>

                    <string>from Either, being in the Mind of Both, and knowing that Mind is One. 3 He is a Thought of God,</string>
                    <string>and God has given Him to you because He has no Thoughts He does not share. 4 His message</string>
                    <string>speaks of timelessness in time, and that is why Christ's vision looks on everything with love. 5 Yet</string>
                    <string>even Christ's vision is not His reality. 6 The golden aspects of reality that spring to light under His</string>
                    <string>loving gaze are partial glimpses of the Heaven that lies beyond them.</string>

                    <string>Son of God is but the true perception of one aspect of the whole. 3 Though every aspect is the</string>
                    <string>whole, you cannot know this until you see that every aspect is the same, perceived in the same light</string>
                    <string>and therefore one. 4 Everyone seen without the past thus brings you nearer to the end of time by</string>
                    <string>bringing healed and healing sight into the darkness, and enabling the world to see. 5 For light must</string>
                    <string>come into the darkened world to make Christ's vision possible even here. 6 Help Him to give His</string>
                    <string>gift of light to all who think they wander in the darkness, and let Him gather them into His quiet</string>

                    <string>4 And every miracle you do contains them all, as every aspect of reality you see blends quietly into</string>
                    <string>the one reality of God. 5 The only miracle that ever was is God's most holy Son, created in the one</string>

                    <string>individual concern. 5 You who are part of it and all of it need only realize that it is of the Father, not</string>

                    <string>forbids awakening. 4 The ego's laws are strict, and breaches are severely punished. 5 Therefore give</string>
                    <string>no obedience to its laws, for they are laws of punishment. 6 And those who follow them believe that</string>
                    <string>they are guilty, and so they must condemn. 7 Between the future and the past the laws of God must</string>
                    <string>intervene, if you would free yourself. 8 Atonement stands between them, like a lamp shining so</string>

                    <string>pain, for faith in it is pain. 4 And faith can be rewarded only in terms of the belief in which the faith</string>
                    <string>was placed. 5 Faith makes the power of belief, and where it is invested determines its reward. 6 For</string>

                    <string>distinction. 2 Therefore you cannot value one without the other, and guilt has become as true for you</string>
                    <string>as innocence. 3 You do not believe the Son of God is guiltless because you see the past, and see him</string>
                    <string>not. 4 When you condemn a brother you are saying, "I who was guilty choose to remain so." 5 You</string>
                    <string>have denied his freedom, and by so doing you have denied the witness unto yours. 6 You could as</string>

                    <string>not. 5 For sin and condemnation are the same, and the belief in one is faith in the other, calling for</string>

                    <string>dark veil over it, and cannot see it because you cannot look within. 4 You are afraid of what you</string>
                    <string>would see there, but it is not there. 5 The thing you fear is gone. 6 If you would look within you</string>

                    <string>Yet this you cannot do without remaining blind. 5 For those who see their brothers in the dark, and</string>
                    <string>guilty in the dark in which they shroud them, are too afraid to look upon the light within. 6 Within</string>
                    <string>you is not what you believe is there, and what you put your faith in. 7 Within you is the holy sign of</string>
                    <string>perfect faith your Father has in you. 8 He does not value you as you do. 9 He knows Himself, and</string>
                    <string>knows the truth in you. 10 He knows there is no difference, for He knows not of differences. 11 Can</string>

                    <string>you cannot change it. 13 Look, then, upon the light He placed within you, and learn that what you</string>

                    <string>that the source of guilt, from which attention is diverted, must be true; and must be fearful, or you</string>
                    <string>would not have displaced the guilt onto what you believed to be less fearful. 4 You are therefore</string>

                    <string>relationship can rest on guilt, or even hold one spot of it to mar its purity. 3 For all relationships that</string>
                    <string>guilt has touched are used but to avoid the person and the guilt. 4 What strange relationships you</string>
                    <string>have made for this strange purpose! 5 And you forgot that real relationships are holy, and cannot be</string>
                    <string>used by you at all. 6 They are used only by the Holy Spirit, and it is that which makes them pure. 7</string>
                    <string>If you displace your guilt upon them, the Holy Spirit cannot use them. 8 For, by pre-empting for</string>
                    <string>your own ends what you should have given Him, He cannot use it for your release. 9 No one who</string>
                    <string>would unite in any way with anyone for his individual salvation will find it in that strange</string>
                    <string>relationship. 10 It is not shared, and so it is not real.</string>

                    <string>because your union with him is not real. 3 You will see guilt in that relationship because you put it</string>
                    <string>there. 4 It is inevitable that those who suffer guilt will attempt to displace it, because they do believe</string>
                    <string>in it. 5 Yet though they suffer, they will not look within and let it go. 6 They cannot know they love,</string>
                    <string>and cannot understand what loving is. 7 Their main concern is to perceive the source of guilt outside</string>

                    <string>insane, and has no reason. 4 The Holy Spirit seeks not to dispel reality. 5 If guilt were real,</string>
                    <string>Atonement would not be. 6 The purpose of Atonement is to dispel illusions, not to establish them as</string>

                    <string>will remember how much his Father loves him. 5 And it will seem incredible that he ever thought his</string>
                    <string>Father loved him not, and looked upon him as condemned. 6 The moment that you realize guilt is</string>
                    <string>insane, wholly unjustified and wholly without reason, you will not fear to look upon the Atonement</string>

                    <string>God, where you are. 8 And this is reason, which the Holy Spirit would restore to you. 9 He would</string>
                    <string>remove only illusions. 10 All else He would have you see. 11 And in Christ's vision He would show</string>

                    <string>5 Seek not to love unlike Him, for there is no love apart from His. 6 Until you recognize that this is</string>
                    <string>true, you will have no idea what love is like. 7 No one who condemns a brother can see himself as</string>
                    <string>guiltless and in the peace of God. 8 If he is guiltless and in peace and sees it not, he is delusional,</string>
                    <string>and has not looked upon himself. 9 To him I say: 10 Behold the Son of God, and look upon his</string>

                    <string>this entails the recognition that guilt is interference, not salvation, and serves no useful function at</string>

                    <string>do not look upon it as having value in itself. 2 You believe that guilt and guiltlessness are both of</string>
                    <string>value, each representing an escape from what the other does not offer you. 3 You do not want either</string>
                    <string>alone, for without both you do not see yourself as whole and therefore happy. 4 Yet you are whole</string>
                    <string>only in your guiltlessness, and only in your guiltlessness can you be happy. 5 There is no conflict</string>
                    <string>here. 6 To wish for guilt in any way, in any form, will lose appreciation of the value of your</string>

                    <string>of guilt seems to attract you, remember that if you yield to it, you are deciding against your</string>
                    <string>happiness, and will not learn how to be happy. 4 Say therefore, to yourself, gently, but with the</string>
                    <string>conviction born of the Love of God and of His Son: 5 What I experience I will make manifest. 6 If I</string>
                    <string>am guiltless, I have nothing to fear. 7 I choose to testify to my acceptance of the Atonement, not to</string>
                    <string>its rejection. 8 I would accept my guiltlessness by making it manifest and sharing it. 9 Let me bring</string>

                    <string>you can decide between is fixed, because there are no alternatives except truth and illusion. 5 And</string>
                    <string>there is no overlap between them, because they are opposites which cannot be reconciled and cannot</string>

                    <string>comes from choosing to be free of guilt. 4 Everyone you offer healing to returns it. 5 Everyone you</string>
                    <string>attack keeps it and cherishes it by holding it against you. 6 Whether he does this or does it not will</string>
                    <string>make no difference; you will think he does. 7 It is impossible to offer what you do not want without</string>
                    <string>this penalty. 8 The cost of giving is receiving. 9 Either it is a penalty from which you suffer, or the</string>

                    <string>given him to heal is another opportunity to replace darkness with light and fear with love. 3 If he</string>
                    <string>refuses it he binds himself to darkness, because he did not choose to free his brother and enter light</string>
                    <string>with him. 4 By giving power to nothing, he throws away the joyous opportunity to learn that nothing</string>
                    <string>has no power. 5 And by not dispelling darkness, he became afraid of darkness and of light. 6 The</string>
                    <string>joy of learning that darkness has no power over the Son of God is the happy lesson the Holy Spirit</string>
                    <string>teaches, and would have you teach with Him. 7 It is His joy to teach it, as it will be yours.</string>

                    <string>Therefore, make your invulnerability manifest to everyone. 3 Teach him that, whatever he may try</string>
                    <string>to do to you, your perfect freedom from the belief that you can be harmed shows him that he is</string>
                    <string>guiltless. 4 He can do nothing that can hurt you, and by refusing to allow him to think he can, you</string>
                    <string>teach him that the Atonement, which you have accepted for yourself, is also his. 5 There is nothing</string>
                    <string>to forgive. 6 No one can hurt the Son of God. 7 His guilt is wholly without cause, and being without</string>

                    <string>you do, you teach yourself that what is not of God has power over you. 3 The causeless cannot be. 4</string>
                    <string>Do not attest to it, and do not foster belief in it in any mind. 5 Remember always that mind is one,</string>
                    <string>and cause is one. 6 You will learn communication with this oneness only when you learn to deny</string>
                    <string>the causeless, and accept the Cause of God as yours. 7 The power that God has given to His Son is</string>
                    <string>his, and nothing else can His Son see or choose to look upon without imposing on himself the</string>

                    <string>guiltlessness is your Atonement. 5 Grant it to him, and you will see the truth of what you have</string>
                    <string>acknowledged. 6 Yet truth is offered first to be received, even as God gave it first to His Son. 7 The</string>

                    <string>2 Giving Himself is all He knows, and so it is all knowledge. 3 For what He knows not cannot be,</string>

                    <string>Ask, rather, to learn how to forgive, and to restore what always was to your unforgiving mind. 6</string>
                    <string>Atonement becomes real and visible to those who use it. 7 On earth this is your only function, and</string>

                    <string>them they are gone. 4 God will not fail, nor ever has in anything. 5 Decide that God is right and you</string>
                    <string>are wrong about yourself. 6 He created you out of Himself, but still within Him. 7 He knows what</string>
                    <string>you are. 8 Remember that there is no second to Him. 9 There cannot, therefore, be anyone without</string>
                    <string>His Holiness, nor anyone unworthy of His perfect Love. 10 Fail not in your function of loving in a</string>
                    <string>loveless place made out of darkness and deceit, for thus are darkness and deceit undone. 11 Fail not</string>
                    <string>yourself, but instead offer to God and you His blameless Son. 12 For this small gift of appreciation</string>

                    <string>is! 7 Do not endow Him with attributes you understand. 8 You made Him not, and anything you</string>

                    <string>to minds that have denied it, and thus denied Heaven to themselves. 3 Atonement teaches you the</string>
                    <string>true condition of the Son of God. 4 It does not teach you what you are, or what your Father is. 5 The</string>

                    <string>you are remembering nothing. 8 Remembrance of reality is in Him, and therefore in you.</string>

                    <string>you perceive the frightening, and shrink away from it to further darkness. 4 And yet it is only the</string>
                    <string>hidden that can terrify, not for what it is, but for its hiddenness. 5 The obscure is frightening because</string>
                    <string>you do not understand its meaning. 6 If you did, it would be clear and you would be no longer in the</string>
                    <string>dark. 7 Nothing has hidden value, for what is hidden cannot be shared, and so its value is unknown.</string>
                    <string>8 The hidden is kept apart, but value always lies in joint appreciation. 9 What is concealed cannot be</string>
                    <string>loved, and so it must be feared.</string>

                    <string>brought to love, not hidden from it. 3 There is no darkness that the light of love will not dispel,</string>
                    <string>unless it is concealed from love's beneficence. 4 What is kept apart from love cannot share its</string>
                    <string>healing power, because it has been separated off and kept in darkness. 5 The sentinels of darkness</string>
                    <string>watch over it carefully, and you who made these guardians of illusion out of nothing are now afraid</string>

                    <string>nothing at all. 5 As guardians of darkness and of ignorance look to them only for fear, for what they</string>
                    <string>keep obscure is fearful. 6 But let them go, and what was fearful will be so no longer. 7 Without</string>
                    <string>protection of obscurity only the light of love remains, for only this has meaning and can live in</string>

                    <string>confusing them with each other. 5 And so you do not realize that only one means anything. 6 The</string>

                    <string>has been made obscure. 3 All things you made have use to Him, for His most holy purpose. 4 He</string>

                    <string>at once, and this must lead to unintelligibility. 6 Yet if one means nothing and the other everything,</string>

                    <string>becomes unreal to you because you hid it and surrounded it with fear. 7 Under each cornerstone of</string>
                    <string>fear on which you have erected your insane system of belief, the truth lies hidden. 8 Yet you cannot</string>
                    <string>know this, for by hiding truth in fear, you see no reason to believe that the more you look at fear the</string>
                    <string>less you see it, and the clearer what it conceals becomes.</string>

                    <string>the "unknowing" are. 5 To God, unknowing is impossible. 6 It is therefore not a point of view at all,</string>
                    <string>but merely a belief in something that does not exist. 7 It is only this belief that the unknowing have,</string>
                    <string>and by it they are wrong about themselves. 8 They have defined themselves as they were not</string>
                    <string>created. 9 Their creation was not a point of view, but rather a certainty. 10 Uncertainty brought to</string>

                    <string>consider what dissociation is. 3 Dissociation is a distorted process of thinking whereby two systems</string>

                    <string>acceptance becomes impossible. 5 But if one is kept in darkness from the other, their separation</string>
                    <string>seems to keep them both alive and equal in their reality. 6 Their joining thus becomes the source of</string>
                    <string>fear, for if they meet, acceptance must be withdrawn from one of them. 7 You cannot have them</string>
                    <string>both, for each denies the other. 8 Apart, this fact is lost from sight, for each in a separate place can</string>

                    <string>does not defend itself. 4 Defense is of your making. 5 God knows it not. 6 The Holy Spirit uses</string>
                    <string>defenses on behalf of truth only because you made them against it. 7 His perception of them,</string>
                    <string>according to His purpose, merely changes them into a call for what you have attacked with them. 8</string>
                    <string>Defenses, like everything you made, must be gently turned to your own good, translated by the Holy</string>

                    <string>the power of God is with Him. 10 Therefore, to Him it is so easy that it was accomplished the</string>
                    <string>instant it was given Him for you. 11 Do not delay in your return to peace by wondering how He can</string>
                    <string>fulfill what God has given Him to do. 12 Leave that to Him Who knows. 13 You are not asked to do</string>
                    <string>mighty tasks yourself. 14 You are merely asked to do the little He suggests you do, trusting Him</string>
                    <string>only to the small extent of believing that, if He asks it, you can do it. 15 You will see how easily all</string>

                    <string>with Him Whom God has given you teaches you how to recognize what you see. 4 It is the</string>
                    <string>recognition that nothing you see means anything alone. 5 Seeing with Him will show you that all</string>
                    <string>meaning, including yours, comes not from double vision, but from the gentle fusing of everything</string>

                    <string>dark denial of innocence. 3 Behind the dark doors you have closed lies nothing, because nothing can</string>
                    <string>obscure the gift of God. 4 It is the closing of the doors that interferes with recognition of the power</string>

                    <string>be brought to the judgment of the Holy Spirit, and there undone. 6 Whom He would save for glory</string>
                    <string>is saved for it. 7 He has promised the Father that through Him you would be released from littleness</string>
                    <string>to glory. 8 To what He promised God He is wholly faithful, for He shares with God the promise that</string>

                    <string>altar to your Father and His Son. 3 No altar stands to God without His Son. 4 And nothing brought</string>
                    <string>there that is not equally worthy of Both, but will be replaced by gifts wholly acceptable to Father</string>
                    <string>and to Son. 5 Can you offer guilt to God? 6 You cannot, then, offer it to His Son. 7 For They are</string>
                    <string>not apart, and gifts to One are offered to the Other. 8 You know not God because you know not this.</string>
                    <string>9 And yet you do know God and also this. 10 All this is safe within you, where the Holy Spirit</string>

                    <string>lie only in shifting interpretations, rather than in themselves. 3 The reflection of God needs no</string>
                    <string>interpretation. 4 It is clear. 5 Clean but the mirror, and the message that shines forth from what the</string>
                    <string>mirror holds out for everyone to see, no one can fail to understand. 6 It is the message that the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit is holding to the mirror that is in him. 7 He recognizes it because he has been taught his need</string>
                    <string>for it, but knows not where to look to find it. 8 Let him, then, see it in you and share it with you.</string>

                    <string>to receive the image of the holiness that heals the world. 2 The image of holiness that shines in your</string>
                    <string>mind is not obscure, and will not change. 3 Its meaning to those who look upon it is not obscure, for</string>
                    <string>everyone perceives it as the same. 4 All bring their different problems to its healing light, and all</string>

                    <string>in them, are ready at last for Heaven. 5 There, holiness is not a reflection, but rather the actual</string>
                    <string>condition of what was but reflected to them here. 6 God is no image, and His creations, as part of</string>

                    <string>from time to holiness, as surely as the reflection of holiness calls everyone to lay all guilt aside. 6</string>
                    <string>Reflect the peace of Heaven here, and bring this world to Heaven. 7 For the reflection of truth</string>

                    <string>becomes the only perception the Son of God accepts. 3 And thus, remembrance of his Father dawns</string>
                    <string>on him, and he can no longer be satisfied with anything but his own reality. 4 You on earth have no</string>
                    <string>conception of limitlessness, for the world you seem to live in is a world of limits. 5 In this world, it</string>
                    <string>is not true that anything without order of difficulty can occur. 6 The miracle, therefore, has a unique</string>
                    <string>function, and is motivated by a unique Teacher Who brings the laws of another world to this one. 7</string>
                    <string>The miracle is the one thing you can do that transcends order, being based not on differences but on</string>

                    <string>They can be simultaneous and legion. 3 This is not difficult to understand, once you conceive of</string>
                    <string>them as possible at all. 4 What is more difficult to grasp is the lack of order of difficulty that stamps</string>
                    <string>the miracle as something that must come from elsewhere, not from here. 5 From the world's</string>
                    <string>viewpoint, this is impossible.</string>

                    <string>though they may conflict, can occur together and in great numbers. 2 You may indeed be so used to</string>
                    <string>this that it causes you little surprise. 3 Yet you are also used to classifying some of your thoughts as</string>
                    <string>more important, larger or better, wiser, or more productive and valuable than others. 4 This is true</string>
                    <string>of the thoughts that cross the mind of those who think they live apart. 5 For some are reflections of</string>
                    <string>Heaven, while others are motivated by the ego, which but seems to think.</string>

                    <string>unceasingly across the mirror of your mind, and the reflections of Heaven last but a moment and</string>
                    <string>grow dim, as darkness blots them out. 3 Where there was light, darkness removes it in an instant,</string>
                    <string>and alternating patterns of light and darkness sweep constantly across your mind. 4 The little sanity</string>
                    <string>that still remains is held together by a sense of order that you establish. 5 Yet the very fact that you</string>
                    <string>can do this, and bring any order into chaos shows you that you are not an ego, and that more than an</string>
                    <string>ego must be in you. 6 For the ego is chaos, and if it were all of you, no order at all would be</string>
                    <string>possible. 7 Yet though the order you impose upon your mind limits the ego, it also limits you. 8 To</string>
                    <string>order is to judge, and to arrange by judgment. 9 Therefore it is not your function, but the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit's.</string>

                    <string>T-14.X.6. It will seem difficult for you to learn that you have no basis at all for ordering your</string>
                    <string>thoughts. 2 This lesson the Holy Spirit teaches by giving you the shining examples of miracles to</string>
                    <string>show you that your way of ordering is wrong, but that a better way is offered you. 3 The miracle</string>
                    <string>offers exactly the same response to every call for help. 4 It does not judge the call. 5 It merely</string>
                    <string>recognizes what it is, and answers accordingly. 6 It does not consider which call is louder or greater</string>
                    <string>or more important. 7 You may wonder how you who are still bound to judgment can be asked to do</string>
                    <string>that which requires no judgment of your own. 8 The answer is very simple. 9 The power of God,</string>
                    <string>and not of you, engenders miracles. 10 The miracle itself is but the witness that you have the power</string>
                    <string>of God in you. 11 That is the reason why the miracle gives equal blessing to all who share in it, and</string>
                    <string>that is also why everyone shares in it. 12 The power of God is limitless. 13 And being always</string>
                    <string>maximal, it offers everything to every call from anyone. 14 There is no order of difficulty here. 15</string>
                    <string>A call for help is given help.</string>

                    <string>T-14.X.7. The only judgment involved is the Holy Spirit's one division into two categories; one of</string>
                    <string>love, and the other the call for love. 2 You cannot safely make this division, for you are much too</string>
                    <string>confused either to recognize love, or to believe that everything else is nothing but a call for love. 3</string>
                    <string>You are too bound to form, and not to content. 4 What you consider content is not content at all. 5 It</string>
                    <string>is merely form, and nothing else. 6 For you do not respond to what a brother really offers you, but</string>
                    <string>only to the particular perception of his offering by which the ego judges it.</string>

                    <string>the ego, if the form is acceptable the content must be. 3 Otherwise it will attack the form. 4 If you</string>
                    <string>believe you understand something of the "dynamics" of the ego, let me assure you that you</string>
                    <string>understand nothing of it. 5 For of yourself you could not understand it. 6 The study of the ego is not</string>
                    <string>the study of the mind. 7 In fact, the ego enjoys studying itself, and thoroughly approves the</string>
                    <string>undertakings of students who would "analyze" it, thus approving its importance. 8 Yet they but</string>
                    <string>study form with meaningless content. 9 For their teacher is senseless, though careful to conceal this</string>
                    <string>fact behind impressive sounding words, but which lack any consistent sense when they are put</string>
                    <string>together.</string>

                    <string>them together and the system of thought that arises from joining them is incoherent and utterly</string>
                    <string>chaotic. 3 For form is not enough for meaning, and the underlying lack of content makes a cohesive</string>
                    <string>system impossible. 4 Separation therefore remains the ego's chosen condition. 5 For no one alone</string>
                    <string>can judge the ego truly. 6 Yet when two or more join together in searching for truth, the ego can no</string>
                    <string>longer defend its lack of content. 7 The fact of union tells them it is not true.</string>

                    <string>hold is for yourself. 4 If you would remember your Father, let the Holy Spirit order your thoughts</string>
                    <string>and give only the answer with which He answers you. 5 Everyone seeks for love as you do, but</string>
                    <string>knows it not unless he joins with you in seeking it. 6 If you undertake the search together, you bring</string>
                    <string>with you a light so powerful that what you see is given meaning. 7 The lonely journey fails because</string>

                    <string>secret, and what you would hide from the Holy Spirit is nothing. 4 Every interpretation you would</string>
                    <string>lay upon a brother is senseless. 5 Let the Holy Spirit show him to you, and teach you both his love</string>
                    <string>and his call for love. 6 Neither his mind nor yours holds more than these two orders of thought.</string>

                    <string>what you are. 4 Earlier I said this course will teach you how to remember what you are, restoring to</string>

                    <string>so you have another lesson sent from Him, already learned for every child of light by Him to Whom</string>
                    <string>God gave it. 4 This lesson shines with God's glory, for in it lies His power, which He shares so</string>
                    <string>gladly with His Son. 5 Learn of His happiness, which is yours. 6 But to accomplish this, all your</string>
                    <string>dark lessons must be brought willingly to truth, and joyously laid down by hands open to receive,</string>
                    <string>not closed to take. 7 Every dark lesson that you bring to Him Who teaches light He will accept from</string>
                    <string>you, because you do not want it. 8 And He will gladly exchange each one for the bright lesson He</string>

                    <string>you. 4 The absence of perfect peace means but one thing: You think you do not will for God's Son</string>

                    <string>T-15.I.4. The belief in hell is inescapable to those who identify with the ego. 2 Their nightmares and</string>
                    <string>their fears are all associated with it. 3 The ego teaches that hell is in the future, for this is what all its</string>
                    <string>teaching is directed to. 4 Hell is its goal. 5 For although the ego aims at death and dissolution as an</string>
                    <string>end, it does not believe it. 6 The goal of death, which it craves for you, leaves it unsatisfied. 7 No</string>
                    <string>one who follows the ego's teaching is without the fear of death. 8 Yet if death were thought of</string>
                    <string>merely as an end to pain, would it be feared? 9 We have seen this strange paradox in the ego's</string>
                    <string>thought system before, but never so clearly as here. 10 For the ego must seem to keep fear from you</string>
                    <string>to hold your allegiance. 11 Yet it must engender fear in order to maintain itself. 12 Again the ego</string>
                    <string>tries, and all too frequently succeeds, in doing both, by using dissociation for holding its</string>
                    <string>contradictory aims together so that they seem to be reconciled. 13 The ego teaches thus: Death is</string>
                    <string>the end as far as hope of Heaven goes. 14 Yet because you and the ego cannot be separated, and</string>
                    <string>because it cannot conceive of its own death, it will pursue you still, because guilt is eternal. 15 Such</string>
                    <string>is the ego's version of immortality. 16 And it is this the ego's version of time supports.</string>

                    <string>T-15.I.6. How bleak and despairing is the ego's use of time! 2 And how terrifying! 3 For underneath</string>
                    <string>its fanatical insistence that the past and future be the same is hidden a far more insidious threat to</string>
                    <string>peace. 4 The ego does not advertise its final threat, for it would have its worshippers still believe</string>
                    <string>that it can offer them escape. 5 But the belief in guilt must lead to the belief in hell, and always</string>
                    <string>does. 6 The only way in which the ego allows the fear of hell to be experienced is to bring hell here,</string>
                    <string>but always as a foretaste of the future. 7 For no one who considers himself as deserving of hell can</string>
                    <string>believe that punishment will end in peace.</string>

                    <string>T-15.I.7. The Holy Spirit teaches thus: There is no hell. 2 Hell is only what the ego has made of the</string>
                    <string>present. 3 The belief in hell is what prevents you from understanding the present, because you are</string>
                    <string>afraid of it. 4 The Holy Spirit leads as steadily to Heaven as the ego drives to hell. 5 For the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit, Who knows only the present, uses it to undo the fear by which the ego would make the</string>
                    <string>present useless. 6 There is no escape from fear in the ego's use of time. 7 For time, according to its</string>
                    <string>teaching, is nothing but a teaching device for compounding guilt until it becomes all-encompassing,</string>
                    <string>demanding vengeance forever.</string>

                    <string>past and future, which do not exist. 3 There is no fear in the present when each instant stands clear</string>
                    <string>and separated from the past, without its shadow reaching out into the future. 4 Each instant is a</string>
                    <string>clean, untarnished birth, in which the Son of God emerges from the past into the present. 5 And the</string>
                    <string>present extends forever. 6 It is so beautiful and so clean and free of guilt that nothing but happiness</string>
                    <string>is there. 7 No darkness is remembered, and immortality and joy are now.</string>

                    <string>to misguide you so completely, but it takes no time at all to be what you are. 4 Begin to practice the</string>
                    <string>Holy Spirit's use of time as a teaching aid to happiness and peace. 5 Take this very instant, now,</string>
                    <string>and think of it as all there is of time. 6 Nothing can reach you here out of the past, and it is here that</string>
                    <string>you are completely absolved, completely free and wholly without condemnation. 7 From this holy</string>
                    <string>instant wherein holiness was born again you will go forth in time without fear, and with no sense of</string>

                    <string>instant more than merely that hell does not exist. 3 In this redeeming instant lies Heaven. 4 And</string>
                    <string>Heaven will not change, for the birth into the holy present is salvation from change. 5 Change is an</string>
                    <string>illusion, taught by those who cannot see themselves as guiltless. 6 There is no change in Heaven</string>
                    <string>because there is no change in God. 7 In the holy instant, in which you see yourself as bright with</string>
                    <string>freedom, you will remember God. 8 For remembering Him is to remember freedom.</string>

                    <string>the whole of Heaven. 5 In exchange for this instant He stands ready to give you the remembrance of</string>

                    <string>that his instant of release is yours. 4 Miracles are the instants of release you offer, and will receive. 5</string>
                    <string>They attest to your willingness to be released, and to offer time to the Holy Spirit for His use of it.</string>

                    <string>this blessed instant of freedom to all who are enslaved by time, and thus make time their friend for</string>
                    <string>them. 4 The Holy Spirit gives their blessed instant to you through your giving it. 5 As you give it,</string>
                    <string>He offers it to you. 6 Be not unwilling to give what you would receive of Him, for you join with</string>
                    <string>Him in giving. 7 In the crystal cleanness of the release you give is your instantaneous escape from</string>

                    <string>restore God's whole power to you. 3 He Who transcends time for you understands what time is for.</string>
                    <string>4 Holiness lies not in time, but in eternity. 5 There never was an instant in which God's Son could</string>
                    <string>lose his purity. 6 His changeless state is beyond time, for his purity remains forever beyond attack</string>
                    <string>and without variability. 7 Time stands still in his holiness, and changes not. 8 And so it is no longer</string>
                    <string>time at all. 9 For caught in the single instant of the eternal sanctity of God's creation, it is</string>
                    <string>transformed into forever. 10 Give the eternal instant, that eternity may be remembered for you, in</string>
                    <string>that shining instant of perfect release. 11 Offer the miracle of the holy instant through the Holy</string>

                    <string>reaches out to encompass time, as God extends Himself to encompass you. 5 You who have spent</string>

                    <string>reasons for not letting it go. 3 Yet they are far stronger and much more compelling witnesses for the</string>
                    <string>Holy Spirit. 4 And they support His strength. 5 It is, therefore, your choice whether they support the</string>
                    <string>ego or the Holy Spirit in you. 6 And you will recognize which you have chosen by their reactions. 7</string>
                    <string>A Son of God who has been released through the Holy Spirit in a brother is always recognized. 8</string>
                    <string>He cannot be denied. 9 If you remain uncertain, it is only because you have not given complete</string>
                    <string>release. 10 And because of this, you have not given a single instant completely to the Holy Spirit.</string>
                    <string>11 For when you have, you will be sure you have. 12 You will be sure because the witness to Him</string>
                    <string>will speak so clearly of Him that you will hear and understand. 13 You will doubt until you hear one</string>
                    <string>witness whom you have wholly released through the Holy Spirit. 14 And then you will doubt no</string>

                    <string>There is no doubt about its magnitude, for it reaches you through Him from Magnitude. 3 You do</string>
                    <string>not have to strive for it, because you have it. 4 All your striving must be directed against littleness,</string>
                    <string>for it does require vigilance to protect your magnitude in this world. 5 To hold your magnitude in</string>
                    <string>perfect awareness in a world of littleness is a task the little cannot undertake. 6 Yet it is asked of</string>
                    <string>you, in tribute to your magnitude and not your littleness. 7 Nor is it asked of you alone. 8 The power</string>
                    <string>of God will support every effort you make on behalf of His dear Son. 9 Search for the little, and you</string>
                    <string>deny yourself His power. 10 God is not willing that His Son be content with less than everything. 11</string>
                    <string>For He is not content without His Son, and His Son cannot be content with less than his Father has</string>

                    <string>make does answer this, and invites sorrow or joy accordingly. 4 When God gave Himself to you in</string>
                    <string>your creation, He established you as host to Him forever. 5 He has not left you, and you have not</string>
                    <string>left Him. 6 All your attempts to deny His magnitude, and make His Son hostage to the ego, cannot</string>
                    <string>make little whom God has joined with Him. 7 Every decision you make is for Heaven or for hell,</string>

                    <string>content them. 6 Neither give littleness, nor accept it. 7 All honor is due the host of God. 8 Your</string>

                    <string>can you. 7 When you have learned to accept what you are, you will make no more gifts to offer to</string>
                    <string>yourself, for you will know you are complete, in need of nothing, and unable to accept anything for</string>

                    <string>The holy instant is this instant and every instant. 4 The one you want it to be it is. 5 The one you</string>

                    <string>Yet you cannot bring it into glad awareness while you do not want it, for it holds the whole release</string>

                    <string>it will you bring it nearer. 5 Think not that you can find salvation in your own way and have it. 6</string>
                    <string>Give over every plan you have made for your salvation in exchange for God's. 7 His will content</string>

                    <string>in perfect freedom. 6 Every allegiance to a plan of salvation apart from Him diminishes the value of</string>

                    <string>give over every plan but His. 3 For there lies peace, perfectly clear because you have been willing</string>
                    <string>to meet its conditions. 4 You can claim the holy instant any time and anywhere you want it. 5 In</string>
                    <string>your practice, try to give over every plan you have accepted for finding magnitude in littleness. 6 It</string>

                    <string>T-15.IV.6. The reason this course is simple is that truth is simple. 2 Complexity is of the ego, and is</string>
                    <string>nothing more than the ego's attempt to obscure the obvious. 3 You could live forever in the holy</string>
                    <string>instant, beginning now and reaching to eternity, but for a very simple reason. 4 Do not obscure the</string>
                    <string>simplicity of this reason, for if you do, it will be only because you prefer not to recognize it and not</string>
                    <string>to let it go. 5 The simple reason, simply stated, is this: The holy instant is a time in which you</string>
                    <string>receive and give perfect communication. 6 This means, however, that it is a time in which your</string>
                    <string>mind is open, both to receive and give. 10 7 It is the recognition that all minds are in</string>
                    <string>communication. 8 It therefore seeks to change nothing, but merely to accept everything.</string>

                    <string>The only way you could do that would be to deny the perfect communication that makes the holy</string>
                    <string>instant what it is. 3 You believe you can harbor thoughts you would not share, and that salvation lies</string>
                    <string>in keeping thoughts to yourself alone. 4 For in private thoughts, known only to yourself, you think</string>
                    <string>you find a way to keep what you would have alone, and share what you would share. 5 And then</string>
                    <string>you wonder why it is that you are not in full communication with those around you, and with God</string>
                    <string>Who surrounds all of you together.</string>

                    <string>it so. 2 It is impossible to recognize perfect communication while breaking communication holds</string>
                    <string>value to you. 3 Ask yourself honestly, "Would I want to have perfect communication, and am I</string>
                    <string>wholly willing to let everything that interferes with it go forever?" 4 If the answer is no, then the</string>
                    <string>Holy Spirit's readiness to give it to you is not enough to make it yours, for you are not ready to share</string>
                    <string>it with Him. 5 And it cannot come into a mind that has decided to oppose it. 6 For the holy instant is</string>
                    <string>given and received with equal willingness, being the acceptance of the single Will that governs all</string>
                    <string>thought.</string>

                    <string>that are not pure. 2 But it does require that you have none that you would keep. 3 Innocence is not</string>
                    <string>of your making. 4 It is given you the instant you would have it. 5 Atonement would not be if there</string>
                    <string>were no need for it. 6 You will not be able to accept perfect communication as long as you would</string>
                    <string>hide it from yourself. 7 For what you would hide is hidden from you. 8 In your practice, then, try</string>
                    <string>only to be vigilant against deception, and seek not to protect the thoughts you would keep to</string>
                    <string>yourself. 9 Let the Holy Spirit's purity shine them away, and bring all your awareness to the</string>
                    <string>readiness for purity He offers you. 10 Thus will He make you ready to acknowledge that you are</string>

                    <string>T-15.V.1. The holy instant is the Holy Spirit's most useful learning device for teaching you love's</string>
                    <string>meaning. 2 For its purpose is to suspend judgment entirely. 3 Judgment always rests on the past, for</string>
                    <string>past experience is the basis on which you judge. 4 Judgment becomes impossible without the past,</string>
                    <string>for without it you do not understand anything. 5 You would make no attempt to judge, because it</string>
                    <string>would be quite apparent to you that you do not understand what anything means. 6 You are afraid of</string>
                    <string>this because you believe that without the ego, all would be chaos. 7 Yet I assure you that without the</string>
                    <string>ego, all would be love.</string>

                    <string>T-15.V.2. The past is the ego's chief learning device, for it is in the past that you learned to define</string>
                    <string>your own needs and acquired methods for meeting them on your own terms. 2 We have said that to</string>
                    <string>limit love to part of the Sonship is to bring guilt into your relationships, and thus make them unreal.</string>
                    <string>3 If you seek to separate out certain aspects of the totality and look to them to meet your imagined</string>
                    <string>needs, you are attempting to use separation to save you. 4 How, then, could guilt not enter? 5 For</string>
                    <string>separation is the source of guilt, and to appeal to it for salvation is to believe you are alone. 6 To be</string>
                    <string>alone is to be guilty. 7 For to experience yourself as alone is to deny the Oneness of the Father and</string>
                    <string>His Son, and thus to attack reality.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-15.V.3. You cannot love parts of reality and understand what love means. 2 If you would love</string>
                    <string>unlike to God, Who knows no special love, how can you understand it? 3 To believe that special</string>
                    <string>relationships, with special love, can offer you salvation is the belief that separation is salvation. 4</string>
                    <string>For it is the complete equality of the Atonement in which salvation lies. 5 How can you decide that</string>
                    <string>special aspects of the Sonship can give you more than others? 6 The past has taught you this. 7 Yet</string>
                    <string>the holy instant teaches you it is not so.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-15.V.4. Because of guilt, all special relationships have elements of fear in them. 2 This is why</string>
                    <string>they shift and change so frequently. 3 They are not based on changeless love alone. 4 And love,</string>
                    <string>where fear has entered, cannot be depended on because it is not perfect. 5 In His function as</string>
                    <string>Interpreter of what you made, the Holy Spirit uses special relationships, which you have chosen to</string>
                    <string>support the ego, as learning experiences that point to truth. 6 Under His teaching, every relationship</string>
                    <string>becomes a lesson in love. 12</string>

                    <string>T-15.V.5. The Holy Spirit knows no one is special. 2 Yet He also perceives that you have made</string>
                    <string>special relationships, which He would purify and not let you destroy. 3 However unholy the reason</string>
                    <string>you made them may be, He can translate them into holiness by removing as much fear as you will</string>
                    <string>let Him. 4 You can place any relationship under His care and be sure that it will not result in pain, if</string>
                    <string>you offer Him your willingness to have it serve no need but His. 5 All the guilt in it arises from</string>
                    <string>your use of it. 6 All the love from His. 7 Do not, then, be afraid to let go your imagined needs,</string>
                    <string>which would destroy the relationship. 8 Your only need is His.</string>

                    <string>T-15.V.6. Any relationship you would substitute for another has not been offered to the Holy Spirit</string>
                    <string>for His use. 2 There is no substitute for love. 3 If you would attempt to substitute one aspect of love</string>
                    <string>for another, you have placed less value on one and more on the other. 4 You have not only separated</string>
                    <string>them, but you have also judged against both. 5 Yet you had judged against yourself first, or you</string>
                    <string>would never have imagined that you needed your brothers as they were not. 6 Unless you had seen</string>
                    <string>yourself as without love, you could not have judged them so like you in lack.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-15.V.7. The ego's use of relationships is so fragmented that it frequently goes even farther; one</string>
                    <string>part of one aspect suits its purposes, while it prefers different parts of another aspect. 2 Thus does it</string>
                    <string>assemble reality to its own capricious liking, offering for your seeking a picture whose likeness does</string>
                    <string>not exist. 3 For there is nothing in Heaven or earth that it resembles, and so, however much you seek</string>
                    <string>for its reality, you cannot find it because it is not real.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-15.V.8. Everyone on earth has formed special relationships, and although this is not so in Heaven,</string>
                    <string>the Holy Spirit knows how to bring a touch of Heaven to them here. 2 In the holy instant no one is</string>
                    <string>special, for your personal needs intrude on no one to make your brothers seem different. 3 Without</string>
                    <string>the values from the past, you would see them all the same and like yourself. 4 Nor would you see</string>
                    <string>any separation between yourself and them. 5 In the holy instant, you see in each relationship what it</string>
                    <string>will be when you perceive only the present.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-15.V.9. God knows you now. 2 He remembers nothing, having always known you exactly as He</string>
                    <string>knows you now. 3 The holy instant reflects His knowing by bringing all perception out of the past,</string>
                    <string>thus removing the frame of reference you have built by which to judge your brothers. 4 Once this is</string>
                    <string>gone, the Holy Spirit substitutes His frame of reference for it. 13 5 His frame of reference is simply</string>
                    <string>God. 6 The Holy Spirit's timelessness lies only here. 7 For in the holy instant, free of the past, you</string>
                    <string>see that love is in you, and you have no need to look without and snatch love guiltily from where</string>
                    <string>you thought it was.</string>

                    <string>T-15.V.10. All your relationships are blessed in the holy instant, because the blessing is not limited.</string>
                    <string>2 In the holy instant the Sonship gains as one, and united in your blessing it becomes one to you. 3</string>
                    <string>The meaning of love is the meaning God gave to it. 4 Give to it any meaning apart from His, and it</string>
                    <string>is impossible to understand it. 5 God loves every brother as He loves you; neither less nor more. 6</string>
                    <string>He needs them all equally, and so do you. 7 In time, you have been told to offer miracles as I direct,</string>
                    <string>and let the Holy Spirit bring to you those who are seeking you. 8 Yet in the holy instant you unite</string>
                    <string>directly with God, and all your brothers join in Christ. 9 Those who are joined in Christ are in no</string>
                    <string>way separate. 10 For Christ is the Self the Sonship shares, as God shares His Self with Christ.</string>

                    <string>out of His need to extend His Love. 3 With love in you, you have no need except to extend it. 4 In</string>
                    <string>the holy instant there is no conflict of needs, for there is only one. 5 For the holy instant reaches to</string>
                    <string>eternity, and to the Mind of God. 6 And it is only there love has meaning, and only there can it be</string>
                    <string>understood.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-15.VI.1. It is impossible to use one relationship at the expense of another and not to suffer guilt. 2</string>
                    <string>And it is equally impossible to condemn part of a relationship and find peace within it. 3 Under the</string>
                    <string>Holy Spirit's teaching all relationships are seen as total commitments, yet they do not conflict with</string>
                    <string>one another in any way. 4 Perfect faith in each one, for its ability to satisfy you completely, arises</string>
                    <string>only from perfect faith in yourself. 5 And this you cannot have while guilt remains. 6 And there will</string>
                    <string>be guilt as long as you accept the possibility, and cherish it, that you can make a brother into what</string>
                    <string>he is not, because you would have him so.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>
                </BKParagraph>
                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-15.VI.2. You have so little faith in yourself because you are unwilling to accept the fact that</string>
                    <string>perfect love is in you. 2 And so you seek without for what you cannot find without. 14 3 I offer you</string>
                    <string>my perfect faith in you, in place of all your doubts. 4 But forget not that my faith must be as perfect</string>
                    <string>in all your brothers as it is in you, or it would be a limited gift to you. 5 In the holy instant we share</string>
                    <string>our faith in God's Son because we recognize, together, that he is wholly worthy of it, and in our</string>
                    <string>appreciation of his worth we cannot doubt his holiness. 6 And so we love him.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-15.VI.3. All separation vanishes as holiness is shared. 2 For holiness is power, and by sharing it,</string>
                    <string>it gains in strength. 3 If you seek for satisfaction in gratifying your needs as you perceive them, you</string>
                    <string>must believe that strength comes from another, and what you gain he loses. 4 Someone must always</string>
                    <string>lose if you perceive yourself as weak. 5 Yet there is another interpretation of relationships that</string>
                    <string>transcends the concept of loss of power completely.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                    <string>T-15.VI.4. You do not find it difficult to believe that when another calls on God for love, your call</string>
                    <string>remains as strong. 2 Nor do you think that when God answers him, your hope of answer is</string>
                    <string>diminished. 3 On the contrary, you are more inclined to regard his success as witness to the</string>
                    <string>possibility of yours. 4 That is because you recognize, however dimly, that God is an idea, and so</string>
                    <string>your faith in Him is strengthened by sharing. 5 What you find difficult to accept is the fact that, like</string>
                    <string>your Father, you are an idea. 6 And like Him, you can give yourself completely, wholly without loss</string>
                    <string>and only with gain. 7 Herein lies peace, for here there is no conflict.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-15.VI.5. In the world of scarcity, love has no meaning and peace is impossible. 2 For gain and</string>
                    <string>loss are both accepted, and so no one is aware that perfect love is in him. 3 In the holy instant you</string>
                    <string>recognize the idea of love in you, and unite this idea with the Mind that thought it, and could not</string>
                    <string>relinquish it. 4 By holding it within itself, there is no loss. 5 The holy instant thus becomes a lesson</string>
                    <string>in how to hold all of your brothers in your mind, experiencing not loss but completion. 6 From this</string>
                    <string>it follows you can only give. 7 And this is love, for this alone is natural under the laws of God. 8 In</string>
                    <string>the holy instant the laws of God prevail, and only they have meaning. 9 The laws of this world</string>
                    <string>cease to hold any meaning at all. 10 When the Son of God accepts the laws of God as what he</string>
                    <string>gladly wills, it is impossible that he be bound, or limited in any way. 11 In that instant he is as free</string>
                    <string>as God would have him be. 12 For the instant he refuses to be bound, he is not bound.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-15.VI.6. In the holy instant nothing happens that has not always been. 2 Only the veil that has</string>
                    <string>been drawn across reality is lifted. 3 Nothing has changed. 15 4 Yet the awareness of changelessness</string>
                    <string>comes swiftly as the veil of time is pushed aside. 5 No one who has not yet experienced the lifting</string>
                    <string>of the veil, and felt himself drawn irresistibly into the light behind it, can have faith in love without</string>
                    <string>fear. 6 Yet the Holy Spirit gives you this faith, because He offered it to me and I accepted it. 7 Fear</string>
                    <string>not the holy instant will be denied you, for I denied it not. 8 And through me the Holy Spirit gives it</string>
                    <string>unto you, as you will give it. 9 Let no need you perceive obscure your need of this. 10 For in the</string>
                    <string>holy instant you will recognize the only need the Sons of God share equally, and by this recognition</string>
                    <string>you will join with me in offering what is needed.</string>

                    <string>T-15.VI.7. It is through us that peace will come. 2 Join me in the idea of peace, for in ideas minds</string>
                    <string>can communicate. 3 If you would give yourself as your Father gives His Self, you will learn to</string>
                    <string>understand Selfhood. 4 And therein is love's meaning understood. 5 But remember that</string>
                    <string>understanding is of the mind, and only of the mind. 6 Knowledge is therefore of the mind, and its</string>
                    <string>conditions are in the mind with it. 7 If you were not an idea, and nothing but an idea, you could not</string>
                    <string>be in full communication with all that ever was. 8 Yet as long as you prefer to be something else, or</string>
                    <string>would attempt to be nothing else and something else together, you will not remember the language</string>
                    <string>of communication, which you know perfectly.</string>

                    <string>T-15.VI.8. In the holy instant God is remembered, and the language of communication with all your</string>
                    <string>brothers is remembered with Him. 2 For communication is remembered together, as is truth. 3 There</string>
                    <string>is no exclusion in the holy instant because the past is gone, and with it goes the whole basis for</string>

                    <string>T-15.VII.1. Beyond the poor attraction of the special love relationship, and always obscured by it, is</string>
                    <string>the powerful attraction of the Father for His Son. 2 There is no other love that can satisfy you,</string>
                    <string>because there is no other love. 3 This is the only love that is fully given and fully returned. 4 Being</string>
                    <string>complete, it asks nothing. 5 Being wholly pure, everyone joined in it has everything. 6 This is not</string>
                    <string>the basis for any relationship in which the ego enters. 7 For every relationship on which the ego</string>
                    <string>embarks is special.</string>

                    <string>T-15.VII.2. The ego establishes relationships only to get something. 2 And it would keep the giver</string>
                    <string>bound to itself through guilt. 3 It is impossible for the ego to enter into any relationship without</string>
                    <string>anger, for the ego believes that anger makes friends. 4 This is not its statement, but it is its purpose.</string>
                    <string>5 For the ego really believes that it can get and keep by making guilty. 6 This is its one attraction;</string>
                    <string>an attraction so weak that it would have no hold at all, except that no one recognizes it. 7 For the</string>
                    <string>ego always seems to attract through love, and has no attraction at all to anyone who perceives that it</string>
                    <string>attracts through guilt.</string>

                    <string>T-15.VII.3. The sick attraction of guilt must be recognized for what it is. 2 For having been made</string>
                    <string>real to you, it is essential to look at it clearly, and by withdrawing your investment in it, to learn to</string>
                    <string>let it go. 3 No one would choose to let go what he believes has value. 4 Yet the attraction of guilt</string>
                    <string>has value to you only because you have not looked at what it is, and have judged it completely in</string>
                    <string>the dark. 5 As we bring it to light, your only question will be why it was you ever wanted it. 6 You</string>
                    <string>have nothing to lose by looking open-eyed, for ugliness such as this belongs not in your holy mind.</string>
                    <string>7 This host of God can have no real investment here.</string>

                    <string>T-15.VII.4. We said before that the ego attempts to maintain and increase guilt, but in such a way</string>
                    <string>that you do not recognize what it would do to you. 2 For it is the ego's fundamental doctrine that</string>
                    <string>what you do to others you have escaped. 3 The ego wishes no one well. 4 Yet its survival depends</string>
                    <string>on your belief that you are exempt from its evil intentions. 5 It counsels, therefore, that if you are</string>
                    <string>host to it, it will enable you to direct its anger outward, thus protecting you. 6 And thus it embarks</string>
                    <string>on an endless, unrewarding chain of special relationships, forged out of anger and dedicated to but</string>
                    <string>one insane belief; that the more anger you invest outside yourself, the safer you become.</string>

                    <string>T-15.VII.5. It is this chain that binds the Son of God to guilt, and it is this chain the Holy Spirit</string>
                    <string>would remove from his holy mind. 2 For the chain of savagery belongs not around the chosen host</string>
                    <string>of God, who cannot make himself host to the ego. 3 In the name of his release, and in the Name of</string>
                    <string>Him Who would release him, let us look more closely at the relationships the ego contrives, and let</string>
                    <string>the Holy Spirit judge them truly. 4 For it is certain that if you will look at them, you will offer them</string>
                    <string>gladly to Him. 5 What He can make of them you do not know, but you will become willing to find</string>
                    <string>out, if you are willing first to perceive what you have made of them.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-15.VII.6. In one way or another, every relationship the ego makes is based on the idea that by</string>
                    <string>sacrificing itself, it becomes bigger. 2 The "sacrifice," which it regards as purification, is actually the</string>
                    <string>root of its bitter resentment. 3 For it would prefer to attack directly, and avoid delaying what it</string>
                    <string>really wants. 4 Yet the ego acknowledges "reality" as it sees it, and recognizes that no one could</string>
                    <string>interpret direct attack as love. 5 Yet to make guilty is direct attack, although it does not seem to be.</string>
                    <string>6 For the guilty expect attack, and having asked for it they are attracted to it.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-15.VII.7. In such insane relationships, the attraction of what you do not want seems to be much</string>
                    <string>stronger than the attraction of what you do want. 2 For each one thinks that he has sacrificed</string>
                    <string>something to the other, and hates him for it. 3 Yet this is what he thinks he wants. 4 He is not in</string>
                    <string>love with the other at all. 5 He merely believes he is in love with sacrifice. 6 And for this sacrifice,</string>
                    <string>which he demands of himself, he demands that the other accept the guilt and sacrifice himself as</string>
                    <string>well. 7 Forgiveness becomes impossible, for the ego believes that to forgive another is to lose him. 8</string>
                    <string>It is only by attack without forgiveness that the ego can ensure the guilt that holds all its</string>
                    <string>relationships together.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-15.VII.8. Yet they only seem to be together. 2 For relationships, to the ego, mean only that bodies</string>
                    <string>are together. 3 It is always this that the ego demands, and it does not object where the mind goes or</string>
                    <string>what it thinks, for this seems unimportant. 4 As long as the body is there to receive its sacrifice, it is</string>
                    <string>content. 5 To the ego the mind is private, and only the body can be shared. 6 Ideas are basically of</string>
                    <string>no concern, except as they bring the body of another closer or farther. 7 And it is in these terms that</string>
                    <string>it evaluates ideas as good or bad. 8 What makes another guilty and holds him through guilt is</string>
                    <string>"good." 9 What releases him from guilt is "bad," because he would no longer believe that bodies</string>
                    <string>communicate, and so he would be "gone."</string>

                    <string>T-15.VII.9. Suffering and sacrifice are the gifts with which the ego would "bless" all unions. 2 And</string>
                    <string>those who are united at its altar accept suffering and sacrifice as the price of union. 3 In their angry</string>
                    <string>alliances, born of the fear of loneliness and yet dedicated to the continuance of loneliness, each</string>
                    <string>seeks relief from guilt by increasing it in the other. 4 For each believes that this decreases guilt in</string>
                    <string>him. 5 The other seems always to be attacking and wounding him, perhaps in little ways, perhaps</string>
                    <string>"unconsciously," yet never without demand of sacrifice. 6 The fury of those joined at the ego's altar</string>
                    <string>far exceeds your awareness of it. 7 For what the ego really wants you do not realize.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-15.VII.10. Whenever you are angry, you can be sure that you have formed a special relationship</string>
                    <string>which the ego has "blessed," for anger is its blessing. 2 Anger takes many forms, but it cannot long</string>
                    <string>deceive those who will learn that love brings no guilt at all, and what brings guilt cannot be love and</string>
                    <string>must be anger. 3 All anger is nothing more than an attempt to make someone feel guilty, and this</string>
                    <string>attempt is the only basis the ego accepts for special relationships. 4 Guilt is the only need the ego</string>
                    <string>has, and as long as you identify with it, guilt will remain attractive to you. 5 Yet remember this; to</string>
                    <string>be with a body is not communication. 6 And if you think it is, you will feel guilty about</string>
                    <string>communication and will be afraid to hear the Holy Spirit, recognizing in His Voice your own need</string>
                    <string>to communicate.</string>

                    <string>T-15.VII.11. The Holy Spirit cannot teach through fear. 2 And how can He communicate with you,</string>
                    <string>while you believe that to communicate is to make yourself alone? 3 It is clearly insane to believe</string>
                    <string>that by communicating you will be abandoned. 4 And yet many do believe it. 5 For they think their</string>
                    <string>minds must be kept private or they will lose them, but if their bodies are together their minds</string>
                    <string>remain their own. 6 The union of bodies thus becomes the way in which they would keep minds</string>
                    <string>apart. 7 For bodies cannot forgive. 8 They can only do as the mind directs.</string>

                    <string>T-15.VII.12. The illusion of the autonomy of the body and its ability to overcome loneliness is but</string>
                    <string>the working of the ego's plan to establish its own autonomy. 2 As long as you believe that to be with</string>
                    <string>a body is companionship, you will be compelled to attempt to keep your brother in his body, held</string>
                    <string>there by guilt. 3 And you will see safety in guilt and danger in communication. 4 For the ego will</string>
                    <string>always teach that loneliness is solved by guilt, and that communication is the cause of loneliness. 5</string>
                    <string>And despite the evident insanity of this lesson, many have learned it.</string>

                    <string>Spirit's teaching function to instruct those who believe communication to be damnation that</string>
                    <string>communication is salvation. 3 And He will do so, for the power of God in Him and you is joined in</string>
                    <string>a real relationship so holy and so strong, that it can overcome even this without fear.</string>

                    <string>evident that it is not impossible. 2 In the holy instant guilt holds no attraction, since communication</string>
                    <string>has been restored. 3 And guilt, whose only purpose is to disrupt communication, has no function</string>
                    <string>here. 4 Here there is no concealment, and no private thoughts. 5 The willingness to communicate</string>
                    <string>attracts communication to it, and overcomes loneliness completely. 6 There is complete forgiveness</string>
                    <string>here, for there is no desire to exclude anyone from your completion, in sudden recognition of the</string>

                    <string>assignment such as His, He must use everything in this world for your release. 3 He must side with</string>
                    <string>every sign or token of your willingness to learn of Him what the truth must be. 4 He is swift to</string>
                    <string>utilize whatever you offer Him on behalf of this. 5 His concern and care for you are limitless. 6 In</string>
                    <string>the face of your fear of forgiveness, which He perceives as clearly as He knows forgiveness is</string>
                    <string>release, He will teach you to remember that forgiveness is not loss, but your salvation. 7 And that in</string>
                    <string>complete forgiveness, in which you recognize that there is nothing to forgive, you are absolved</string>

                    <string>does, for He would teach you what you do not understand. 4 God would respond to every need,</string>
                    <string>whatever form it takes. 5 And so He keeps this channel open to receive His communication to you,</string>
                    <string>and yours to Him. 6 God does not understand your problem in communication, for He does not</string>
                    <string>share it with you. 7 It is only you who believe that it is understandable. 8 The Holy Spirit knows that</string>

                    <string>and deprived of meaning, it will not satisfy you completely. 6 Yet it remains the only means by</string>

                    <string>every use the ego has for the body, and to accept the fact that the ego has no purpose you would</string>
                    <string>share with it. 3 For the ego would limit everyone to a body for its own purposes, and while you</string>
                    <string>think it has a purpose, you will choose to utilize the means by which it tries to turn its purpose into</string>
                    <string>accomplishment. 4 This will never be accomplished. 5 Yet you have surely recognized that the ego,</string>
                    <string>whose goals are altogether unattainable, will strive for them with all its might, and will do so with</string>

                    <string>and ineffectual. 4 Limit your sight of a brother to his body, which you will do as long as you would</string>
                    <string>not release him from it, and you have denied his gift to you. 5 His body cannot give it. 6 And seek it</string>

                    <string>the attraction of God. 3 His attraction for you remains unlimited, but because your power, being His,</string>
                    <string>is as great as His, you can turn away from love. 4 What you invest in guilt you withdraw from God.</string>
                    <string>5 And your sight grows weak and dim and limited, for you have attempted to separate the Father</string>

                    <string>limit not your vision of God's Son to what interferes with his release, and what the Holy Spirit must</string>

                    <string>upon the Son of God, and his unlimited power is thus restored to him. 3 What other gift can you</string>
                    <string>offer me, when only this I choose to offer you? 4 And to see me is to see me in everyone, and offer</string>
                    <string>everyone the gift you offer me. 5 I am as incapable of receiving sacrifice as God is, and every</string>
                    <string>sacrifice you ask of yourself you ask of me. 6 Learn now that sacrifice of any kind is nothing but a</string>
                    <string>limitation imposed on giving. 7 And by this limitation you have limited acceptance of the gift I</string>

                    <string>the ego takes many forms, it is always the same idea. 5 What is not love is always fear, and nothing</string>

                    <string>necessary to examine each one as long as you would retain the principle that governs all of them. 3</string>
                    <string>When you are willing to regard them, not as separate, but as different manifestations of the same</string>
                    <string>idea, and one you do not want, they go together. 4 The idea is simply this: You believe it is possible</string>
                    <string>to be host to the ego or hostage to God. 5 This is the choice you think you have, and the decision</string>
                    <string>you believe that you must make. 6 You see no other alternatives, for you cannot accept the fact that</string>
                    <string>sacrifice gets nothing. 7 Sacrifice is so essential to your thought system that salvation apart from</string>
                    <string>sacrifice means nothing to you. 8 Your confusion of sacrifice and love is so profound that you</string>
                    <string>cannot conceive of love without sacrifice. 9 And it is this that you must look upon; sacrifice is</string>
                    <string>attack, not love. 10 If you would accept but this one idea, your fear of love would vanish. 11 Guilt</string>
                    <string>cannot last when the idea of sacrifice has been removed. 12 For if there is sacrifice, someone must</string>
                    <string>pay and someone must get. 13 And the only question that remains is how much is the price, and for</string>
                    <string>getting what.</string>

                    <string>that the ego does demand payment it never seems to be demanding it of you. 4 You are unwilling to</string>

                    <string>The ego will never let you perceive this, since this recognition would make it homeless. 6 For when</string>

                    <string>from your sight. 7 Each form will be recognized as but a cover for the one idea that hides behind</string>
                    <string>them all; that love demands sacrifice, and is therefore inseparable from attack and fear. 8 And that</string>

                    <string>perhaps, but the other to be destroyed. 4 For you see love as destructive, and your only question is</string>

                    <string>you ascribed the ego's treachery, inviting it to take His place to protect you from Him. 6 And you do</string>

                    <string>of you. 7 No partial sacrifice will appease this savage guest, for it is an invader who but seems to</string>
                    <string>offer kindness, but always to make the sacrifice complete.</string>

                    <string>relationship in which the suffering is shared. 3 The capacity to empathize is very useful to the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit, provided you let Him use it in His way. 4 His way is very different. 5 He does not understand</string>
                    <string>suffering, and would have you teach it is not understandable. 6 When He relates through you, He</string>
                    <string>does not relate through your ego to another ego. 7 He does not join in pain, understanding that</string>
                    <string>healing pain is not accomplished by delusional attempts to enter into it, and lighten it by sharing the</string>

                    <string>understands, the ego sees itself and would increase itself by sharing what is like itself. 5 Make no</string>
                    <string>mistake about this maneuver; the ego always empathizes to weaken, and to weaken is always to</string>
                    <string>attack. 6 You do not know what empathizing means. 7 Yet of this you may be sure; if you will</string>
                    <string>merely sit quietly by and let the Holy Spirit relate through you, you will empathize with strength,</string>

                    <string>that you would share, for there is nothing from the past that you would keep. 6 Do not use empathy</string>
                    <string>to make the past real, and so perpetuate it. 7 Step gently aside, and let healing be done for you. 8</string>

                    <string>T-16.III.7. This year you will begin to learn, and make learning commensurate with teaching. 2 You</string>
                    <string>have chosen this by your own willingness to teach. 3 Though you seemed to suffer for it, the joy of</string>
                    <string>teaching will yet be yours. 4 For the joy of teaching is in the learner, who offers it to the teacher in</string>
                    <string>gratitude, and shares it with him. 5 As you learn, your gratitude to your Self, Who teaches you what</string>
                    <string>He is, will grow and help you honor Him. 6 And you will learn His power and strength and purity,</string>
                    <string>and love Him as His Father does. 7 His Kingdom has no limits and no end, and there is nothing in</string>
                    <string>Him that is not perfect and eternal. 8 All this is you, and nothing outside of this is you.</string>

                    <string>created you as you are. 2 Sooner or later must everyone bridge the gap he imagines exists between</string>
                    <string>his selves. 3 Each one builds this bridge, which carries him across the gap as soon as he is willing</string>
                    <string>to expend some little effort on behalf of bridging it. 4 His little efforts are powerfully supplemented</string>
                    <string>by the strength of Heaven, and by the united will of all who make Heaven what it is, being joined</string>
                    <string>within it. 5 And so the one who would cross over is literally transported there.</string>

                    <string>T-16.IV.1. Be not afraid to look upon the special hate relationship, for freedom lies in looking at it.</string>
                    <string>2 It would be impossible not to know the meaning of love, except for this. 3 For the special love</string>
                    <string>relationship, in which the meaning of love is hidden, is undertaken solely to offset the hate, but not</string>
                    <string>to let it go. 4 Your salvation will rise clearly before your open eyes as you look on this. 5 You</string>
                    <string>cannot limit hate. 6 The special love relationship will not offset it, but will merely drive it</string>
                    <string>underground and out of sight. 7 It is essential to bring it into sight, and to make no attempt to hide</string>
                    <string>it. 8 For it is the attempt to balance hate with love that makes love meaningless to you. 9 The extent</string>
                    <string>of the split that lies in this you do not realize. 10 And until you do, the split will remain</string>
                    <string>unrecognized, and therefore unhealed.</string>

                    <string>everything. 3 You will go through this last undoing quite unharmed, and will at last emerge as</string>
                    <string>yourself. 4 This is the last step in the readiness for God. 5 Be not unwilling now; you are too near,</string>
                    <string>and you will cross the bridge in perfect safety, translated quietly from war to peace. 6 For the</string>
                    <string>illusion of love will never satisfy, but its reality, which awaits you on the other side, will give you</string>
                    <string>everything.</string>

                    <string>T-16.IV.3. The special love relationship is an attempt to limit the destructive effects of hate by</string>
                    <string>finding a haven in the storm of guilt. 2 It makes no attempt to rise above the storm, into the</string>
                    <string>sunlight. 3 On the contrary, it emphasizes the guilt outside the haven by attempting to build</string>
                    <string>barricades against it, and keep within them. 4 The special love relationship is not perceived as a</string>
                    <string>value in itself, but as a place of safety from which hatred is split off and kept apart. 5 The special</string>
                    <string>love partner is acceptable only as long as he serves this purpose. 6 Hatred can enter, and indeed is</string>
                    <string>welcome in some aspects of the relationship, but it is still held together by the illusion of love. 7 If</string>
                    <string>the illusion goes, the relationship is broken or becomes unsatisfying on the grounds of</string>
                    <string>disillusionment.</string>

                    <string>T-16.IV.4. Love is not an illusion. 2 It is a fact. 3 Where disillusionment is possible, there was not</string>
                    <string>love but hate. 4 For hate is an illusion, and what can change was never love. 5 It is sure that those</string>
                    <string>who select certain ones as partners in any aspect of living, and use them for any purpose which they</string>
                    <string>would not share with others, are trying to live with guilt rather than die of it. 6 This is the choice</string>
                    <string>they see. 7 And love, to them, is only an escape from death. 8 They seek it desperately, but not in</string>
                    <string>the peace in which it would gladly come quietly to them. 9 And when they find the fear of death is</string>
                    <string>still upon them, the love relationship loses the illusion that it is what it is not. 10 When the</string>
                    <string>barricades against it are broken, fear rushes in and hatred triumphs.</string>

                    <string>3 The illusion of love can triumph over the illusion of hate, but always at the price of making both</string>
                    <string>illusions. 4 As long as the illusion of hatred lasts, so long will love be an illusion to you. 5 And then</string>
                    <string>the only choice remaining possible is which illusion you prefer. 6 There is no conflict in the choice</string>
                    <string>between truth and illusion. 7 Seen in these terms, no one would hesitate. 8 But conflict enters the</string>
                    <string>instant the choice seems to be one between illusions, but this choice does not matter. 9 Where one</string>
                    <string>choice is as dangerous as the other, the decision must be one of despair.</string>

                    <string>yourself that you have built against it. 2 It is not necessary to seek for what is true, but it is</string>
                    <string>necessary to seek for what is false. 3 Every illusion is one of fear, whatever form it takes. 4 And the</string>
                    <string>attempt to escape from one illusion into another must fail. 5 If you seek love outside yourself you</string>
                    <string>can be certain that you perceive hatred within, and are afraid of it. 6 Yet peace will never come</string>

                    <string>from illusion: The special love relationship is an attempt to bring love into separation. 2 And, as</string>
                    <string>such, it is nothing more than an attempt to bring love into fear, and make it real in fear. 3 In</string>
                    <string>fundamental violation of love's one condition, the special love relationship would accomplish the</string>
                    <string>impossible. 4 How but in illusion could this be done? 5 It is essential that we look very closely at</string>
                    <string>exactly what it is you think you can do to solve the dilemma which seems very real to you, but</string>
                    <string>which does not exist. 6 You have come close to truth, and only this stands between you and the</string>

                    <string>you to look on all your brothers with gratitude, because your creations were created in union with</string>
                    <string>them. 6 Acceptance of your creations is the acceptance of the Oneness of creation, without which</string>

                    <string>love or hate, deprives you of knowledge for fantasies are the veil behind which truth is hidden. 4 To</string>

                    <string>For love is wholly without illusion, and therefore wholly without fear. 10 Whom God remembers</string>
                    <string>must be whole. 11 And God has never forgotten what makes Him whole. 12 In your completion lie</string>
                    <string>the memory of His Wholeness and His gratitude to you for His completion. 13 In His link with you</string>

                    <string>appeal to those unwilling to relinquish guilt. 2 The "dynamics" of the ego are clearest here, for</string>
                    <string>counting on the attraction of this offering, the fantasies that center around it are often quite overt. 3</string>
                    <string>Here they are usually judged to be acceptable and even natural. 4 No one considers it bizarre to love</string>
                    <string>and hate together, and even those who believe that hate is sin merely feel guilty, but do not correct</string>
                    <string>it. 5 This is the "natural" condition of the separation, and those who learn that it is not natural at all</string>
                    <string>seem to be the unnatural ones. 6 For this world is the opposite of Heaven, being made to be its</string>
                    <string>opposite, and everything here takes a direction exactly opposite of what is true. 7 In Heaven, where</string>
                    <string>the meaning of love is known, love is the same as union. 8 Here, where the illusion of love is</string>
                    <string>accepted in love's place, love is perceived as separation and exclusion.</string>

                    <string>the ego's hatred triumphs. 2 For the special relationship is the renunciation of the Love of God, and</string>
                    <string>the attempt to secure for the self the specialness that He denied. 3 It is essential to the preservation</string>
                    <string>of the ego that you believe this specialness is not hell, but Heaven. 4 For the ego would never have</string>
                    <string>you see that separation could only be loss, being the one condition in which Heaven could not be.</string>

                    <string>the ego and the Holy Spirit accept it. 3 They are, however, in complete disagreement on what</string>
                    <string>completion is, and how it is accomplished. 4 The Holy Spirit knows that completion lies first in</string>
                    <string>union, and then in the extension of union. 5 To the ego completion lies in triumph, and in the</string>
                    <string>extension of the "victory" even to the final triumph over God. 6 In this it sees the ultimate freedom</string>
                    <string>of the self, for nothing would remain to interfere with the ego. 7 This is its idea of Heaven. 8 And</string>
                    <string>therefore union, which is a condition in which the ego cannot interfere, must be hell.</string>

                    <string>T-16.V.6. The special relationship is a strange and unnatural ego device for joining hell and</string>
                    <string>Heaven, and making them indistinguishable. 2 And the attempt to find the imagined "best" of both</string>
                    <string>worlds has merely led to fantasies of both, and to the inability to perceive either as it is. 3 The</string>
                    <string>special relationship is the triumph of this confusion. 4 It is a kind of union from which union is</string>
                    <string>excluded, and the basis for the attempt at union rests on exclusion. 5 What better example could</string>
                    <string>there be of the ego's maxim, "Seek but do not find"?</string>

                    <string>relationship. 2 This "self" seeks the relationship to make itself complete. 3 Yet when it finds the</string>
                    <string>special relationship in which it thinks it can accomplish this it gives itself away, and tries to "trade"</string>
                    <string>itself for the self of another. 4 This is not union, for there is no increase and no extension. 5 Each</string>
                    <string>partner tries to sacrifice the self he does not want for one he thinks he would prefer. 6 And he feels</string>
                    <string>guilty for the "sin" of taking, and of giving nothing of value in return. 7 How much value can he</string>
                    <string>place upon a self that he would give away to get a "better" one?</string>

                    <string>to possess a special self is "loved" for what can be taken from him. 3 Where both partners see this</string>
                    <string>special self in each other, the ego sees "a union made in Heaven." 4 For neither one will recognize</string>
                    <string>that he has asked for hell, and so he will not interfere with the ego's illusion of Heaven, which it</string>
                    <string>offered him to interfere with Heaven. 5 Yet if all illusions are of fear, and they can be of nothing</string>
                    <string>else, the illusion of Heaven is nothing more than an "attractive" form of fear, in which the guilt is</string>

                    <string>those who place their faith in littleness. 2 The conviction of littleness lies in every special</string>
                    <string>relationship, for only the deprived could value specialness. 3 The demand for specialness, and the</string>
                    <string>perception of the giving of specialness as an act of love, would make love hateful. 4 The real</string>
                    <string>purpose of the special relationship, in strict accordance with the ego's goals, is to destroy reality and</string>
                    <string>substitute illusion. 5 For the ego is itself an illusion, and only illusions can be the witnesses to its</string>

                    <string>Let us not think of its fearful nature, nor of the guilt it must entail, nor of the sadness and the</string>
                    <string>loneliness. 3 For these are only attributes of the whole religion of separation, and of the total context</string>
                    <string>in which it is thought to occur. 4 The central theme in its litany to sacrifice is that God must die so</string>
                    <string>you can live. 5 And it is this theme that is acted out in the special relationship. 6 Through the death</string>
                    <string>of your self you think you can attack another self, and snatch it from the other to replace the self</string>
                    <string>that you despise. 7 And you despise it because you do not think it offers the specialness that you</string>
                    <string>demand. 8 And hating it you have made it little and unworthy, because you are afraid of it.</string>

                    <string>has the truth become to you that unless it is weak and little, and unworthy of value, you would not</string>
                    <string>dare to look upon it. 3 You think it safer to endow the little self you made with power you wrested</string>
                    <string>from truth, triumphing over it and leaving it helpless. 4 See how exactly is this ritual enacted in the</string>
                    <string>special relationship. 5 An altar is erected in between two separate people, on which each seeks to</string>
                    <string>kill his self, and on his body raise another self to take its power from his death. 6 Over and over and</string>
                    <string>over this ritual is enacted. 7 And it is never completed, nor ever will be completed. 8 The ritual of</string>
                    <string>completion cannot complete, for life arises not from death, nor Heaven from hell.</string>

                    <string>remember love is content, and not form of any kind. 2 The special relationship is a ritual of form,</string>
                    <string>aimed at raising the form to take the place of God at the expense of content. 3 There is no meaning</string>
                    <string>in the form, and there will never be. 4 The special relationship must be recognized for what it is; a</string>
                    <string>senseless ritual in which strength is extracted from the death of God, and invested in His killer as</string>
                    <string>the sign that form has triumphed over content, and love has lost its meaning. 5 Would you want this</string>
                    <string>to be possible, even apart from its evident impossibility? 6 If it were possible, you would have made</string>
                    <string>yourself helpless. 7 God is not angry. 8 He merely could not let this happen. 9 You cannot change</string>
                    <string>His Mind. 10 No rituals that you have set up in which the dance of death delights you can bring</string>
                    <string>death to the eternal. 11 Nor can your chosen substitute for the Wholeness of God have any influence</string>

                    <string>exclusively, as it is seen here. 3 The little spark that holds the Great Rays within it is also visible,</string>
                    <string>and this spark cannot be limited long to littleness. 4 Once you have crossed the bridge, the value of</string>
                    <string>the body is so diminished in your sight that you will see no need at all to magnify it. 5 For you will</string>
                    <string>realize that the only value the body has is to enable you to bring your brothers to the bridge with</string>
                    <string>you, and to be released together there.</string>

                    <string>T-16.VI.7. The bridge itself is nothing more than a transition in the perspective of reality. 2 On this</string>
                    <string>side, everything you see is grossly distorted and completely out of perspective. 3 What is little and</string>
                    <string>insignificant is magnified, and what is strong and powerful cut down to littleness. 4 In the transition</string>
                    <string>there is a period of confusion, in which a sense of actual disorientation may occur. 5 But fear it not,</string>
                    <string>for it means only that you have been willing to let go your hold on the distorted frame of reference</string>
                    <string>that seemed to hold your world together. 6 This frame of reference is built around the special</string>
                    <string>relationship. 7 Without this illusion there could be no meaning you would still seek here.</string>

                    <string>T-16.VI.8. Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality. 2 Time is kind, and if</string>
                    <string>you use it on behalf of reality, it will keep gentle pace with you in your transition. 3 The urgency is</string>
                    <string>only in dislodging your mind from its fixed position here. 4 This will not leave you homeless and</string>
                    <string>without a frame of reference. 5 The period of disorientation, which precedes the actual transition, is</string>
                    <string>far shorter than the time it took to fix your mind so firmly on illusions. 6 Delay will hurt you now</string>
                    <string>more than before, only because you realize it is delay, and that escape from pain is really possible. 7</string>
                    <string>Find hope and comfort, rather than despair, in this: You could not long find even the illusion of</string>
                    <string>love in any special relationship here. 8 For you are no longer wholly insane, and you would soon</string>
                    <string>recognize the guilt of self-betrayal for what it is.</string>

                    <string>cannot keep part of the thought system that taught you it was real, and understand the Thought that</string>
                    <string>knows what you are. 3 You have allowed the Thought of your reality to enter your mind, and</string>
                    <string>because you invited it, it will abide with you. 4 Your love for it will not allow you to betray yourself,</string>
                    <string>and you could not enter into a relationship where it could not go with you, for you would not want</string>
                    <string>to be apart from it.</string>

                    <string>back with longing on the travesty it made of your relationships. 2 Now no one need suffer, for you</string>
                    <string>have come too far to yield to the illusion of the beauty and holiness of guilt. 3 Only the wholly</string>
                    <string>insane could look on death and suffering, sickness and despair, and see it thus. 4 What guilt has</string>
                    <string>wrought is ugly, fearful and very dangerous. 5 See no illusion of truth and beauty there. 6 And be</string>
                    <string>you thankful that there is a place where truth and beauty wait for you. 7 Go on to meet them gladly,</string>
                    <string>and learn how much awaits you for the simple willingness to give up nothing because it is nothing.</string>

                    <string>where Heaven is. 2 From this side, it seems to be outside and across the bridge. 3 Yet as you cross</string>
                    <string>to join it, it will join with you and become one with you. 4 And you will think, in glad astonishment,</string>
                    <string>that for all this you gave up nothing! 5 The joy of Heaven, which has no limit, is increased with</string>
                    <string>each light that returns to take its rightful place within it. 6 Wait no longer, for the Love of God and</string>
                    <string>you. 7 And may the holy instant speed you on the way, as it will surely do if you but let it come to</string>

                    <string>release you. 2 He needs only your willingness to share His perspective to give it to you completely.</string>
                    <string>3 And your willingness need not be complete because His is perfect. 4 It is His task to atone for</string>
                    <string>your unwillingness by His perfect faith, and it is His faith you share with Him there. 5 Out of your</string>
                    <string>recognition of your unwillingness for your release, His perfect willingness is given you. 6 Call upon</string>
                    <string>Him, for Heaven is at His Call. 7 And let Him call on Heaven for you.</string>

                    <string>T-16.VII.1. It is impossible to let the past go without relinquishing the special relationship. 2 For the</string>
                    <string>special relationship is an attempt to re-enact the past and change it. 3 Imagined slights, remembered</string>
                    <string>pain, past disappointments, perceived injustices and deprivations all enter into the special</string>
                    <string>relationship, which becomes a way in which you seek to restore your wounded self-esteem. 4 What</string>
                    <string>basis would you have for choosing a special partner without the past? 5 Every such choice is made</string>
                    <string>because of something "evil" in the past to which you cling, and for which must someone else atone.</string>

                    <string>T-16.VII.2. The special relationship takes vengeance on the past. 2 By seeking to remove suffering</string>
                    <string>in the past, it overlooks the present in its preoccupation with the past and its total commitment to it.</string>
                    <string>3 No special relationship is experienced in the present. 4 Shades of the past envelop it, and make it</string>
                    <string>what it is. 5 It has no meaning in the present, and if it means nothing now, it cannot have any real</string>
                    <string>meaning at all. 6 How can you change the past except in fantasy? 7 And who can give you what you</string>
                    <string>think the past deprived you of? 8 The past is nothing. 9 Do not seek to lay the blame for deprivation</string>
                    <string>on it, for the past is gone. 10 You cannot really not let go what has already gone. 11 It must be,</string>
                    <string>therefore, that you are maintaining the illusion that it has not gone because you think it serves some</string>
                    <string>purpose that you want fulfilled. 12 And it must also be that this purpose could not be fulfilled in the</string>
                    <string>present, but only in the past.</string>

                    <string>T-16.VII.3. Do not underestimate the intensity of the ego's drive for vengeance on the past. 2 It is</string>
                    <string>completely savage and completely insane. 3 For the ego remembers everything you have done that</string>
                    <string>has offended it, and seeks retribution of you. 4 The fantasies it brings to its chosen relationships in</string>
                    <string>which to act out its hate are fantasies of your destruction. 5 For the ego holds the past against you,</string>
                    <string>and in your escape from the past it sees itself deprived of the vengeance it believes you so justly</string>
                    <string>merit. 6 Yet without your alliance in your own destruction, the ego could not hold you to the past. 7</string>
                    <string>In the special relationship you are allowing your destruction to be. 8 That this is insane is obvious. 9</string>
                    <string>But what is less obvious is that the present is useless to you while you pursue the ego's goal as its</string>
                    <string>ally.</string>

                    <string>and would teach you salvation is past and so you must return to the past to find salvation. 2 There is</string>
                    <string>no fantasy that does not contain the dream of retribution for the past. 3 Would you act out the</string>
                    <string>dream, or let it go?</string>

                    <string>T-16.VII.5. In the special relationship it does not seem to be an acting out of vengeance that you</string>
                    <string>seek. 2 And even when the hatred and the savagery break briefly through, the illusion of love is not</string>
                    <string>profoundly shaken. 3 Yet the one thing the ego never allows to reach awareness is that the special</string>
                    <string>relationship is the acting out of vengeance on yourself. 4 Yet what else could it be? 5 In seeking the</string>
                    <string>special relationship, you look not for glory in yourself. 6 You have denied that it is there, and the</string>
                    <string>relationship becomes your substitute for it. 7 And vengeance becomes your substitute for</string>
                    <string>Atonement, and the escape from vengeance becomes your loss.</string>

                    <string>T-16.VII.6. Against the ego's insane notion of salvation the Holy Spirit gently lays the holy instant.</string>
                    <string>2 We said before that the Holy Spirit must teach through comparisons, and uses opposites to point to</string>
                    <string>truth. 3 The holy instant is the opposite of the ego's fixed belief in salvation through vengeance for</string>
                    <string>the past. 4 In the holy instant it is understood that the past is gone, and with its passing the drive for</string>
                    <string>vengeance has been uprooted and has disappeared. 5 The stillness and the peace of now enfold you</string>
                    <string>in perfect gentleness. 6 Everything is gone except the truth.</string>

                    <string>2 Yet you will not attempt this long. 3 In the holy instant the power of the Holy Spirit will prevail,</string>
                    <string>because you joined Him. 4 The illusions you bring with you will weaken the experience of Him for</string>
                    <string>a while, and will prevent you from keeping the experience in your mind. 5 Yet the holy instant is</string>
                    <string>eternal, and your illusions of time will not prevent the timeless from being what it is, nor you from</string>
                    <string>experiencing it as it is.</string>

                    <string>have no reality apart from your receiving them. 3 Your receiving completes His giving. 4 You will</string>
                    <string>receive because it is His Will to give. 5 He gave the holy instant to be given you, and it is</string>
                    <string>impossible that you receive it not because He gave it. 6 When He willed that His Son be free, His</string>
                    <string>Son was free. 7 In the holy instant is His reminder that His Son will always be exactly as he was</string>
                    <string>created. 8 And everything the Holy Spirit teaches is to remind you that you have received what God</string>

                    <string>perceive in them. 6 Thus will you learn that you have been forgiven, for it is you who offered them</string>

                    <string>T-17.I.1. The betrayal of the Son of God lies only in illusions, and all his "sins" are but his own</string>
                    <string>imagining. 2 His reality is forever sinless. 3 He need not be forgiven but awakened. 4 In his dreams</string>
                    <string>he has betrayed himself, his brothers and his God. 5 Yet what is done in dreams has not been really</string>
                    <string>done. 6 It is impossible to convince the dreamer that this is so, for dreams are what they are because</string>
                    <string>of their illusion of reality. 7 Only in waking is the full release from them, for only then does it</string>
                    <string>become perfectly apparent that they had no effect upon reality at all, and did not change it. 8</string>
                    <string>Fantasies change reality. 9 That is their purpose. 10 They cannot do so in reality, but they can do so</string>
                    <string>in the mind that would have reality be different.</string>

                    <string>T-17.I.2. It is, then, only your wish to change reality that is fearful, because by your wish you think</string>
                    <string>you have accomplished what you wish. 2 This strange position, in a sense, acknowledges your</string>
                    <string>power. 3 Yet by distorting it and devoting it to "evil," it also makes it unreal. 4 You cannot be</string>
                    <string>faithful to two masters who ask conflicting things of you. 5 What you use in fantasy you deny to</string>
                    <string>truth. 6 Yet what you give to truth to use for you is safe from fantasy.</string>

                    <string>T-17.I.3. When you maintain that there must be an order of difficulty in miracles, all you mean is</string>
                    <string>that there are some things you would withhold from truth. 2 You believe truth cannot deal with them</string>
                    <string>only because you would keep them from truth. 3 Very simply, your lack of faith in the power that</string>
                    <string>heals all pain arises from your wish to retain some aspects of reality for fantasy. 4 If you but</string>
                    <string>realized what this must do to your appreciation of the whole! 5 What you reserve for yourself, you</string>
                    <string>take away from Him Who would release you. 6 Unless you give it back, it is inevitable that your</string>
                    <string>perspective on reality be warped and uncorrected.</string>

                    <string>T-17.I.4. As long as you would have it so, so long will the illusion of an order of difficulty in</string>
                    <string>miracles remain with you. 2 For you have established this order in reality by giving some of it to</string>
                    <string>one teacher, and some to another. 3 And so you learn to deal with part of the truth in one way, and</string>
                    <string>in another way the other part. 4 To fragment truth is to destroy it by rendering it meaningless. 5</string>
                    <string>Orders of reality is a perspective without understanding; a frame of reference for reality to which it</string>
                    <string>cannot really be compared at all.</string>

                    <string>T-17.I.5. Think you that you can bring truth to fantasy, and learn what truth means from the</string>
                    <string>perspective of illusions? 2 Truth has no meaning in illusion. 3 The frame of reference for its</string>
                    <string>meaning must be itself. 4 When you try to bring truth to illusions, you are trying to make illusions</string>
                    <string>real, and keep them by justifying your belief in them. 5 But to give illusions to truth is to enable</string>
                    <string>truth to teach that the illusions are unreal, and thus enable you to escape from them. 6 Reserve not</string>
                    <string>one idea aside from truth, or you establish orders of reality that must imprison you. 7 There is no</string>
                    <string>order in reality, because everything there is true.</string>

                    <string>T-17.I.6. Be willing, then, to give all you have held outside the truth to Him Who knows the truth,</string>
                    <string>and in Whom all is brought to truth. 2 Salvation from separation would be complete, or will not be</string>
                    <string>at all. 3 Be not concerned with anything except your willingness to have this be accomplished. 4 He</string>
                    <string>will accomplish it; not you. 5 But forget not this: When you become disturbed and lose your peace</string>
                    <string>of mind because another is attempting to solve his problems through fantasy, you are refusing to</string>
                    <string>forgive yourself for just this same attempt. 6 And you are holding both of you away from truth and</string>
                    <string>from salvation. 7 As you forgive him, you restore to truth what was denied by both of you. 8 And</string>
                    <string>you will see forgiveness where you have given it.</string>

                    <string>T-17.II.1. Can you imagine how beautiful those you forgive will look to you? 2 In no fantasy have</string>
                    <string>you ever seen anything so lovely. 3 Nothing you see here, sleeping or waking, comes near to such</string>
                    <string>loveliness. 4 And nothing will you value like unto this, nor hold so dear. 5 Nothing that you</string>
                    <string>remember that made your heart sing with joy has ever brought you even a little part of the happiness</string>
                    <string>this sight will bring you. 6 For you will see the Son of God. 7 You will behold the beauty the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit loves to look upon, and which He thanks the Father for. 8 He was created to see this for you,</string>
                    <string>until you learned to see it for yourself. 9 And all His teaching leads to seeing it and giving thanks</string>
                    <string>with Him.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-17.II.2. This loveliness is not a fantasy. 2 It is the real world, bright and clean and new, with</string>
                    <string>everything sparkling under the open sun. 3 Nothing is hidden here, for everything has been forgiven</string>
                    <string>and there are no fantasies to hide the truth. 4 The bridge between that world and this is so little and</string>
                    <string>so easy to cross, that you could not believe it is the meeting place of worlds so different. 5 Yet this</string>
                    <string>little bridge is the strongest thing that touches on this world at all. 6 This little step, so small it has</string>
                    <string>escaped your notice, is a stride through time into eternity, beyond all ugliness into beauty that will</string>
                    <string>enchant you, and will never cease to cause you wonderment at its perfection.</string>

                    <string>T-17.II.3. This step, the smallest ever taken, is still the greatest accomplishment of all in God's plan</string>
                    <string>of Atonement. 2 All else is learned, but this is given, complete and wholly perfect. 3 No one but</string>
                    <string>Him Who planned salvation could complete it thus. 4 The real world, in its loveliness, you learn to</string>
                    <string>reach. 5 Fantasies are all undone, and no one and nothing remain still bound by them, and by your</string>
                    <string>own forgiveness you are free to see. 6 Yet what you see is only what you made, with the blessing of</string>
                    <string>your forgiveness on it. 7 And with this final blessing of God's Son upon himself, the real perception,</string>
                    <string>born of the new perspective he has learned, has served its purpose.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                    <string>T-17.II.4. The stars will disappear in light, and the sun that opened up the world to beauty will</string>
                    <string>vanish. 2 Perception will be meaningless when it has been perfected, for everything that has been</string>
                    <string>used for learning will have no function. 3 Nothing will ever change; no shifts nor shadings, no</string>
                    <string>differences, no variations that made perception possible will still occur. 4 The perception of the real</string>
                    <string>world will be so short that you will barely have time to thank God for it. 5 For God will take the last</string>
                    <string>step swiftly, when you have reached the real world and have been made ready for Him.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                    <string>T-17.II.5. The real world is attained simply by the complete forgiveness of the old, the world you</string>
                    <string>see without forgiveness. 2 The great Transformer of perception will undertake with you the careful</string>
                    <string>searching of the mind that made this world, and uncover to you the seeming reasons for your</string>
                    <string>making it. 3 In the light of the real reason that He brings, as you follow Him, He will show you that</string>
                    <string>there is no reason here at all. 4 Each spot His reason touches grows alive with beauty, and what</string>
                    <string>seemed ugly in the darkness of your lack of reason is suddenly released to loveliness. 5 Not even</string>
                    <string>what the Son of God made in insanity could be without a hidden spark of beauty that gentleness</string>
                    <string>could release.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-17.II.6. All this beauty will rise to bless your sight as you look upon the world with forgiving</string>
                    <string>eyes. 2 For forgiveness literally transforms vision, and lets you see the real world reaching quietly</string>
                    <string>and gently across chaos, removing all illusions that had twisted your perception and fixed it on the</string>
                    <string>past. 3 The smallest leaf becomes a thing of wonder, and a blade of grass a sign of God's perfection.</string>

                    <string>T-17.II.7. From the forgiven world the Son of God is lifted easily into his home. 2 And there he</string>
                    <string>knows that he has always rested there in peace. 3 Even salvation will become a dream, and vanish</string>
                    <string>from his mind. 4 For salvation is the end of dreams, and with the closing of the dream will have no</string>
                    <string>meaning. 5 Who, awake in Heaven, could dream that there could ever be need of salvation?</string>

                    <string>T-17.II.8. How much do you want salvation? 2 It will give you the real world, trembling with</string>
                    <string>readiness to be given you. 3 The eagerness of the Holy Spirit to give you this is so intense He would</string>
                    <string>not wait, although He waits in patience. 4 Meet His patience with your impatience at delay in</string>
                    <string>meeting Him. 5 Go out in gladness to meet with your Redeemer, and walk with Him in trust out of</string>
                    <string>this world, and into the real world of beauty and forgiveness.</string>

                    <string>T-17.III.1. To forgive is merely to remember only the loving thoughts you gave in the past, and</string>
                    <string>those that were given you. 2 All the rest must be forgotten. 3 Forgiveness is a selective</string>
                    <string>remembering, based not on your selection. 4 For the shadow figures you would make immortal are</string>
                    <string>"enemies" of reality. 5 Be willing to forgive the Son of God for what he did not do. 6 The shadow</string>
                    <string>figures are the witnesses you bring with you to demonstrate he did what he did not. 7 Because you</string>
                    <string>bring them, you will hear them. 8 And you who keep them by your own selection do not understand</string>
                    <string>how they came into your mind, and what their purpose is. 9 They represent the evil that you think</string>
                    <string>was done to you. 10 You bring them with you only that you may return evil for evil, hoping that</string>
                    <string>their witness will enable you to think guiltily of another and not harm yourself. 11 They speak so</string>
                    <string>clearly for the separation that no one not obsessed with keeping separation could hear them. 12 They</string>
                    <string>offer you the "reasons" why you should enter into unholy alliances to support the ego's goals, and</string>
                    <string>make your relationships the witness to its power.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                <BKParagraph>
                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-17.III.2. It is these shadow figures that would make the ego holy in your sight, and teach you</string>
                    <string>what you do to keep it safe is really love. 2 The shadow figures always speak for vengeance, and all</string>
                    <string>relationships into which they enter are totally insane. 3 Without exception, these relationships have</string>
                    <string>as their purpose the exclusion of the truth about the other, and of yourself. 4 This is why you see in</string>
                    <string>both what is not there, and make of both the slaves of vengeance. 5 And why whatever reminds you</string>
                    <string>of your past grievances attracts you, and seems to go by the name of love, no matter how distorted</string>
                    <string>the associations by which you arrive at the connection may be. 6 And finally, why all such</string>
                    <string>relationships become attempts at union through the body, for only bodies can be seen as means for</string>
                    <string>vengeance. 7 That bodies are central to all unholy relationships is evident. 8 Your own experience</string>
                    <string>has taught you this. 9 But what you may not realize are all the reasons that go to make the</string>
                    <string>relationship unholy. 10 For unholiness seeks to reinforce itself, as holiness does, by gathering to</string>
                    <string>itself what it perceives as like itself.</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-17.III.3. In the unholy relationship, it is not the body of the other with which union is attempted,</string>
                    <string>but the bodies of those who are not there. 2 For even the body of the other, already a severely</string>
                    <string>limited perception of him, is not the central focus as it is, or in entirety. 3 What can be used for</string>
                    <string>fantasies of vengeance, and what can be most readily associated with those on whom vengeance is</string>
                    <string>really sought, is centered on and separated off as being the only parts of value. 4 Every step taken in</string>
                    <string>the making, the maintaining and the breaking off of the unholy relationship is a move toward further</string>
                    <string>fragmentation and unreality. 5 The shadow figures enter more and more, and the one in whom they</string>
                    <string>seem to be decreases in importance.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-17.III.4. Time is indeed unkind to the unholy relationship. 2 For time is cruel in the ego's hands,</string>
                    <string>as it is kind when used for gentleness. 3 The attraction of the unholy relationship begins to fade and</string>
                    <string>to be questioned almost at once. 4 Once it is formed, doubt must enter in, because its purpose is</string>
                    <string>impossible. 5 The "ideal" of the unholy relationship thus becomes one in which the reality of the</string>

                    <string>T-17.III.5. How can the Holy Spirit bring His interpretation of the body as a means of</string>
                    <string>communication into relationships whose only purpose is separation from reality? 2 What forgiveness</string>
                    <string>is enables Him to do so. 3 If all but loving thoughts have been forgotten, what remains is eternal. 4</string>
                    <string>And the transformed past is made like the present. 5 No longer does the past conflict with now. 6</string>
                    <string>This continuity extends the present by increasing its reality and its value in your perception of it. 7</string>
                    <string>In these loving thoughts is the spark of beauty hidden in the ugliness of the unholy relationship</string>
                    <string>where hatred is remembered; yet there to come alive as the relationship is given to Him Who gives</string>
                    <string>it life and beauty. 8 That is why Atonement centers on the past, which is the source of separation,</string>
                    <string>and where it must be undone. 9 For separation must be corrected where it was made.</string>

                    <string>made. 2 And thus it seeks to guarantee there will be no solution. 3 The Holy Spirit wants only to</string>
                    <string>make His resolutions complete and perfect, and so He seeks and finds the source of problems where</string>
                    <string>it is, and there undoes it. 4 And with each step in His undoing is the separation more and more</string>
                    <string>undone, and union brought closer. 5 He is not at all confused by any "reasons" for separation. 6 All</string>
                    <string>He perceives in separation is that it must be undone. 7 Let Him uncover the hidden spark of beauty</string>
                    <string>in your relationships, and show it to you. 8 Its loveliness will so attract you that you will be</string>
                    <string>unwilling ever to lose the sight of it again. 9 And you will let this spark transform the relationship</string>
                    <string>so you can see it more and more. 10 For you will want it more and more, and become increasingly</string>
                    <string>unwilling to let it be hidden from you. 11 And you will learn to seek for and establish the conditions</string>

                    <string>does not share His purpose can be real. 2 The purpose God ascribed to anything is its only function.</string>
                    <string>3 Because of His reason for creating His relationship with you, the function of relationships became</string>
                    <string>forever "to make happy." 4 And nothing else. 5 To fulfill this function you relate to your creations as</string>
                    <string>God to His. 6 For nothing God created is apart from happiness, and nothing God created but would</string>
                    <string>extend happiness as its Creator did. 7 Whatever does not fulfill this function cannot be real.</string>

                    <string>repeatedly that the Holy Spirit would not deprive you of your special relationships, but would</string>
                    <string>transform them. 4 And all that is meant by that is that He will restore to them the function given</string>
                    <string>them by God. 5 The function you have given them is clearly not to make happy. 6 But the holy</string>
                    <string>relationship shares God's purpose, rather than aiming to make a substitute for it. 7 Every special</string>
                    <string>relationship you have made is a substitute for God's Will, and glorifies yours instead of His because</string>
                    <string>of the illusion that they are different.</string>

                    <string>them because you have raised their substitutes to such predominance that, when truth calls to you, as</string>
                    <string>it does constantly, you answer with a substitute. 3 Every special relationship you have made has, as</string>
                    <string>its fundamental purpose, the aim of occupying your mind so completely that you will not hear the</string>
                    <string>call of truth.</string>

                    <string>T-17.IV.4. In a sense, the special relationship was the ego's answer to the creation of the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit, Who was God's Answer to the separation. 2 For although the ego did not understand what</string>
                    <string>had been created, it was aware of threat. 3 The whole defense system the ego evolved to protect the</string>
                    <string>separation from the Holy Spirit was in response to the gift with which God blessed it, and by His</string>
                    <string>blessing enabled it to be healed. 4 This blessing holds within itself the truth about everything. 5 And</string>
                    <string>the truth is that the Holy Spirit is in close relationship with you, because in Him is your relationship</string>
                    <string>with God restored to you. 6 The relationship with Him has never been broken, because the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit has not been separate from anyone since the separation. 7 And through Him have all your</string>
                    <string>holy relationships been carefully preserved, to serve God's purpose for you.</string>

                    <string>accepted is very anxious to preserve its reason, as it sees it. 2 It does not realize that it is totally</string>
                    <string>insane. 3 And you must realize just what this means if you would be restored to sanity. 4 The insane</string>
                    <string>protect their thought systems, but they do so insanely. 5 And all their defenses are as insane as what</string>
                    <string>they are supposed to protect. 6 The separation has nothing in it, no part, no "reason," and no attribute</string>
                    <string>that is not insane. 7 And its "protection" is part of it, as insane as the whole. 8 The special</string>
                    <string>relationship, which is its chief defense, must therefore be insane.</string>

                    <string>ego is insane. 3 Yet the special relationship still seems to you somehow to be "different." 4 Yet we</string>
                    <string>have looked at it far closer than we have at many other aspects of the ego's thought system that you</string>
                    <string>have been more willing to let go. 5 While this one remains, you will not let the others go. 6 For this</string>
                    <string>one is not different. 7 Retain this one, and you have retained the whole.</string>

                    <string>basis for their effectiveness is that they offer what they defend. 3 What they defend is placed in</string>
                    <string>them for safe-keeping, and as they operate they bring it to you. 4 Every defense operates by giving</string>
                    <string>gifts, and the gift is always a miniature of the thought system the defense protects, set in a golden</string>
                    <string>frame. 5 The frame is very elaborate, all set with jewels, and deeply carved and polished. 6 Its</string>
                    <string>purpose is to be of value in itself, and to divert your attention from what it encloses. 7 But the frame</string>

                    <string>that the picture is almost obliterated by its imposing structure. 3 Into the frame are woven all sorts of</string>
                    <string>fanciful and fragmented illusions of love, set with dreams of sacrifice and self-aggrandizement, and</string>
                    <string>interlaced with gilded threads of self-destruction. 4 The glitter of blood shines like rubies, and the</string>

                    <string>are you really free to choose. 8 Look at the pictures. 9 Both of them. 10 One is a tiny picture, hard</string>
                    <string>to see at all beneath the heavy shadows of its enormous and disproportionate enclosure. 11 The</string>
                    <string>other is lightly framed and hung in light, lovely to look upon for what it is.</string>

                    <string>T-17.IV.13. You who have tried so hard, and are still trying, to fit the better picture into the wrong</string>
                    <string>frame and so combine what cannot be combined, accept this and be glad: These pictures are each</string>
                    <string>framed perfectly for what they represent. 2 One is framed to be out of focus and not seen. 3 The</string>
                    <string>other is framed for perfect clarity. 4 The picture of darkness and of death grows less convincing as</string>
                    <string>you search it out amid its wrappings. 5 As each senseless stone that seems to shine from the frame</string>
                    <string>in darkness is exposed to light, it becomes dull and lifeless, and ceases to distract you from the</string>
                    <string>picture. 6 And finally you look upon the picture itself, seeing at last that, unprotected by the frame, it</string>
                    <string>has no meaning.</string>

                    <string>T-17.IV.14. The other picture is lightly framed, for time cannot contain eternity. 2 There is no</string>
                    <string>distraction here. 3 The picture of Heaven and eternity grows more convincing as you look at it. 4</string>
                    <string>And now, by real comparison, a transformation of both pictures can at last occur. 5 And each is</string>
                    <string>given its rightful place when both are seen in relation to each other. 6 The dark picture, brought to</string>
                    <string>light, is not perceived as fearful, but the fact that it is just a picture is brought home at last. 7 And</string>
                    <string>what you see there you will recognize as what it is; a picture of what you thought was real, and</string>
                    <string>nothing more. 8 For beyond this picture you will see nothing.</string>

                    <string>T-17.IV.15. The picture of light, in clear-cut and unmistakable contrast, is transformed into what</string>
                    <string>lies beyond the picture. 2 As you look on this, you realize that it is not a picture, but a reality. 3 This</string>
                    <string>is no figured representation of a thought system, but the Thought itself. 4 What it represents is there.</string>
                    <string>5 The frame fades gently and God rises to your remembrance, offering you the whole of creation in</string>
                    <string>exchange for your little picture, wholly without value and entirely deprived of meaning.</string>

                    <string>He has given is His. 6 It shines in every part of Him, as in the whole. 7 The whole reality of your</string>
                    <string>relationship with Him lies in our relationship to one another. 8 The holy instant shines alike on all</string>
                    <string>relationships, for in it they are one. 9 For here is only healing, already complete and perfect. 10 For</string>

                    <string>T-17.V.1. The holy relationship is the expression of the holy instant in living in this world. 2 Like</string>
                    <string>everything about salvation, the holy instant is a practical device, witnessed to by its results. 3 The</string>
                    <string>holy instant never fails. 4 The experience of it is always felt. 5 Yet without expression it is not</string>
                    <string>remembered. 6 The holy relationship is a constant reminder of the experience in which the</string>
                    <string>relationship became what it is. 7 And as the unholy relationship is a continuing hymn of hate in</string>
                    <string>praise of its maker, so is the holy relationship a happy song of praise to the Redeemer of</string>
                    <string>relationships.</string>

                    <string>T-17.V.2. The holy relationship, a major step toward the perception of the real world, is learned. 2 It</string>
                    <string>is the old, unholy relationship, transformed and seen anew. 3 The holy relationship is a phenomenal</string>
                    <string>teaching accomplishment. 4 In all its aspects, as it begins, develops and becomes accomplished, it</string>
                    <string>represents the reversal of the unholy relationship. 5 Be comforted in this; the only difficult phase is</string>
                    <string>the beginning. 6 For here, the goal of the relationship is abruptly shifted to the exact opposite of</string>
                    <string>what it was. 7 This is the first result of offering the relationship to the Holy Spirit, to use for His</string>
                    <string>purposes.</string>

                    <string>T-17.V.3. This invitation is accepted immediately, and the Holy Spirit wastes no time in introducing</string>
                    <string>the practical results of asking Him to enter. 2 At once His goal replaces yours. 3 This is</string>
                    <string>accomplished very rapidly, but it makes the relationship seem disturbed, disjunctive and even quite</string>
                    <string>distressing. 4 The reason is quite clear. 5 For the relationship as it is is out of line with its own goal,</string>
                    <string>and clearly unsuited to the purpose that has been accepted for it. 6 In its unholy condition, your goal</string>
                    <string>was all that seemed to give it meaning. 7 Now it seems to make no sense. 8 Many relationships have</string>
                    <string>been broken off at this point, and the pursuit of the old goal re-established in another relationship. 9</string>
                    <string>For once the unholy relationship has accepted the goal of holiness, it can never again be what it</string>
                    <string>was.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-17.V.4. The temptation of the ego becomes extremely intense with this shift in goals. 2 For the</string>
                    <string>relationship has not as yet been changed sufficiently to make its former goal completely without</string>
                    <string>attraction, and its structure is "threatened" by the recognition of its inappropriateness for meeting its</string>
                    <string>new purpose. 3 The conflict between the goal and the structure of the relationship is so apparent that</string>
                    <string>they cannot coexist. 4 Yet now the goal will not be changed. 5 Set firmly in the unholy relationship,</string>
                    <string>there is no course except to change the relationship to fit the goal. 6 Until this happy solution is seen</string>
                    <string>and accepted as the only way out of the conflict, the relationship may seem to be severely strained.</string>

                    <string>T-17.V.5. It would not be kinder to shift the goal more slowly, for the contrast would be obscured,</string>
                    <string>and the ego given time to reinterpret each slow step according to its liking. 2 Only a radical shift in</string>
                    <string>purpose could induce a complete change of mind about what the whole relationship is for. 3 As this</string>
                    <string>change develops and is finally accomplished, it grows increasingly beneficent and joyous. 4 But at</string>
                    <string>the beginning, the situation is experienced as very precarious. 5 A relationship, undertaken by two</string>
                    <string>individuals for their unholy purposes, suddenly has holiness for its goal. 6 As these two contemplate</string>
                    <string>their relationship from the point of view of this new purpose, they are inevitably appalled. 7 Their</string>
                    <string>perception of the relationship may even become quite disorganized. 8 And yet, the former</string>
                    <string>organization of their perception no longer serves the purpose they have agreed to meet.</string>

                    <string>T-17.V.6. This is the time for faith. 2 You let this goal be set for you. 3 That was an act of faith. 4</string>
                    <string>Do not abandon faith, now that the rewards of faith are being introduced. 5 If you believed the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit was there to accept the relationship, why would you now not still believe that He is there to</string>
                    <string>purify what He has taken under His guidance? 6 Have faith in your brother in what but seems to be</string>
                    <string>a trying time. 7 The goal is set. 8 And your relationship has sanity as its purpose. 9 For now you</string>
                    <string>find yourself in an insane relationship, recognized as such in the light of its goal.</string>

                    <string>T-17.V.7. Now the ego counsels thus; substitute for this another relationship to which your former</string>
                    <string>goal was quite appropriate. 2 You can escape from your distress only by getting rid of your brother.</string>
                    <string>3 You need not part entirely if you choose not to do so. 4 But you must exclude major areas of</string>
                    <string>fantasy from your brother, to save your sanity. 5 Hear not this now! 6 Have faith in Him Who</string>
                    <string>answered you. 7 He heard. 8 Has He not been very explicit in His answer? 9 You are not now</string>
                    <string>wholly insane. 10 Can you deny that He has given you a most explicit statement? 11 Now He asks</string>
                    <string>for faith a little longer, even in bewilderment. 12 For this will go, and you will see the justification</string>
                    <string>for your faith emerge, to bring you shining conviction. 13 Abandon Him not now, nor your brother.</string>
                    <string>14 This relationship has been reborn as holy.</string>

                    <string>perceive its purpose work in it to make it holy. 2 You will find many opportunities to blame your</string>
                    <string>brother for the "failure" of your relationship, for it will seem at times to have no purpose. 3 A sense</string>
                    <string>of aimlessness will come to haunt you, and to remind you of all the ways you once sought for</string>
                    <string>satisfaction and thought you found it. 4 Forget not now the misery you really found, and do not</string>
                    <string>breathe life into your failing ego. 5 For your relationship has not been disrupted. 6 It has been</string>

                    <string>the means as they stand now which seems to make you suffer, but which makes Heaven glad. 5 If</string>
                    <string>Heaven were outside you, you could not share in its gladness. 6 Yet because it is within, the</string>

                    <string>T-17.VI.1. The practical application of the Holy Spirit's purpose is extremely simple, but it is</string>
                    <string>unequivocal. 2 In fact, in order to be simple it must be unequivocal. 3 The simple is merely what is</string>
                    <string>easily understood, and for this it is apparent that it must be clear. 4 The setting of the Holy Spirit's</string>
                    <string>goal is general. 5 Now He will work with you to make it specific, for application is specific. 6 There</string>
                    <string>are certain very specific guidelines He provides for any situation, but remember that you do not yet</string>
                    <string>realize their universal application. 7 Therefore, it is essential at this point to use them in each</string>
                    <string>situation separately, until you can more safely look beyond each situation, in an understanding far</string>
                    <string>broader than you now possess.</string>

                    <string>T-17.VI.2. In any situation in which you are uncertain, the first thing to consider, very simply, is</string>
                    <string>"What do I want to come of this? 2 What is it for?" 3 The clarification of the goal belongs at the</string>
                    <string>beginning, for it is this which will determine the outcome. 4 In the ego's procedure this is reversed.</string>
                    <string>5 The situation becomes the determiner of the outcome, which can be anything. 6 The reason for</string>
                    <string>this disorganized approach is evident. 7 The ego does not know what it wants to come of the</string>
                    <string>situation. 8 It is aware of what it does not want, but only that. 9 It has no positive goal at all.</string>

                    <string>T-17.VI.3. Without a clear-cut, positive goal, set at the outset, the situation just seems to happen,</string>
                    <string>and makes no sense until it has already happened. 2 Then you look back at it, and try to piece</string>
                    <string>together what it must have meant. 3 And you will be wrong. 4 Not only is your judgment in the</string>
                    <string>past, but you have no idea what should happen. 5 No goal was set with which to bring the means in</string>
                    <string>line. 6 And now the only judgment left to make is whether or not the ego likes it; is it acceptable, or</string>
                    <string>does it call for vengeance? 7 The absence of a criterion for outcome, set in advance, makes</string>
                    <string>understanding doubtful and evaluation impossible.</string>

                    <string>T-17.VI.4. The value of deciding in advance what you want to happen is simply that you will</string>
                    <string>perceive the situation as a means to make it happen. 2 You will therefore make every effort to</string>
                    <string>overlook what interferes with the accomplishment of your objective, and concentrate on everything</string>
                    <string>that helps you meet it. 3 It is quite noticeable that this approach has brought you closer to the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit's sorting out of truth and falsity. 4 The true becomes what can be used to meet the goal. 5 The</string>
                    <string>false becomes the useless from this point of view. 6 The situation now has meaning, but only</string>
                    <string>because the goal has made it meaningful.</string>

                    <string>T-17.VI.5. The goal of truth has further practical advantages. 2 If the situation is used for truth and</string>
                    <string>sanity, its outcome must be peace. 3 And this is quite apart from what the outcome is. 4 If peace is</string>
                    <string>the condition of truth and sanity, and cannot be without them, where peace is they must be. 5 Truth</string>
                    <string>comes of itself. 6 If you experience peace, it is because the truth has come to you and you will see</string>
                    <string>the outcome truly, for deception cannot prevail against you. 7 You will recognize the outcome</string>
                    <string>because you are at peace. 8 Here again you see the opposite of the ego's way of looking, for the ego</string>
                    <string>believes the situation brings the experience. 9 The Holy Spirit knows that the situation is as the goal</string>
                    <string>determines it, and is experienced according to the goal.</string>

                    <string>T-17.VI.6. The goal of truth requires faith. 2 Faith is implicit in the acceptance of the Holy Spirit's</string>
                    <string>purpose, and this faith is all-inclusive. 3 Where the goal of truth is set, there faith must be. 4 The</string>
                    <string>Holy Spirit sees the situation as a whole. 5 The goal establishes the fact that everyone involved in it</string>
                    <string>will play his part in its accomplishment. 6 This is inevitable. 7 No one will fail in anything. 8 This</string>
                    <string>seems to ask for faith beyond you, and beyond what you can give. 9 Yet this is so only from the</string>
                    <string>viewpoint of the ego, for the ego believes in "solving" conflict through fragmentation, and does not</string>
                    <string>perceive the situation as a whole. 10 Therefore, it seeks to split off segments of the situation and</string>
                    <string>deal with them separately, for it has faith in separation and not in wholeness.</string>

                    <string>T-17.VI.7. Confronted with any aspect of the situation that seems to be difficult, the ego will</string>
                    <string>attempt to take this aspect elsewhere, and resolve it there. 2 And it will seem to be successful, except</string>
                    <string>that this attempt conflicts with unity, and must obscure the goal of truth. 3 And peace will not be</string>
                    <string>experienced except in fantasy. 4 Truth has not come because faith has been denied, being withheld</string>
                    <string>from where it rightfully belonged. 5 Thus do you lose the understanding of the situation the goal of</string>
                    <string>truth would bring. 6 For fantasy solutions bring but the illusion of experience, and the illusion of</string>
                    <string>peace is not the condition in which truth can enter.</string>

                    <string>T-17.VII.1. The substitutes for aspects of the situation are the witnesses to your lack of faith. 2</string>
                    <string>They demonstrate that you did not believe the situation and the problem were in the same place. 3</string>
                    <string>The problem was the lack of faith, and it is this you demonstrate when you remove it from its source</string>
                    <string>and place it elsewhere. 4 As a result, you do not see the problem. 5 Had you not lacked faith that it</string>
                    <string>could be solved, the problem would be gone. 6 And the situation would have been meaningful to</string>
                    <string>you, because the interference in the way of understanding would have been removed. 7 To remove</string>
                    <string>the problem elsewhere is to keep it, for you remove yourself from it and make it unsolvable.</string>

                    <string>aspect of the problem but will make solution impossible. 3 For if you shift part of the problem</string>
                    <string>elsewhere the meaning of the problem must be lost, and the solution to the problem is inherent in its</string>
                    <string>meaning. 4 Is it not possible that all your problems have been solved, but you have removed</string>
                    <string>yourself from the solution? 5 Yet faith must be where something has been done, and where you see</string>

                    <string>T-17.VII.3. A situation is a relationship, being the joining of thoughts. 2 If problems are perceived,</string>
                    <string>it is because the thoughts are judged to be in conflict. 3 But if the goal is truth, this is impossible. 4</string>
                    <string>Some idea of bodies must have entered, for minds cannot attack. 5 The thought of bodies is the sign</string>
                    <string>of faithlessness, for bodies cannot solve anything. 6 It is their intrusion on the relationship, an error</string>
                    <string>in your thoughts about the situation, which then becomes the justification for your lack of faith. 7</string>
                    <string>You will make this error, but be not at all concerned with that. 8 The error does not matter. 9</string>
                    <string>Faithlessness brought to faith will never interfere with truth. 10 But faithlessness used against truth</string>
                    <string>will always destroy faith. 11 If you lack faith, ask that it be restored where it was lost, and seek not</string>
                    <string>to have it made up to you elsewhere, as if you had been unjustly deprived of it.</string>

                    <string>goal of holiness was set for your relationship, and not by you. 3 You did not set it because holiness</string>

                    <string>brother was so limited and little. 4 Your faith must grow to meet the goal that has been set. 5 The</string>
                    <string>goal's reality will call this forth, for you will see that peace and faith will not come separately. 6</string>

                    <string>what it offers you. 8 It interferes, not with the goal, but with the value of the goal to you. 9 Accept</string>

                    <string>dedication is divided. 3 And so you have been faithless to your brother, and used your faithlessness</string>
                    <string>against him. 4 No relationship is holy unless its holiness goes with it everywhere. 5 As holiness and</string>
                    <string>faith go hand in hand, so must its faith go everywhere with it. 6 The goal's reality will call forth and</string>
                    <string>accomplish every miracle needed for its fulfillment. 7 Nothing too small or too enormous, too weak</string>
                    <string>or too compelling, but will be gently turned to its use and purpose. 8 The universe will serve it</string>

                    <string>T-17.VIII.1. The holy instant is nothing more than a special case, or an extreme example, of what</string>
                    <string>every situation is meant to be. 2 The meaning that the Holy Spirit's purpose has given it is also</string>
                    <string>given to every situation. 3 It calls forth just the same suspension of faithlessness, withheld and left</string>
                    <string>unused, that faith might answer to the call of truth. 4 The holy instant is the shining example, the</string>
                    <string>clear and unequivocal demonstration of the meaning of every relationship and every situation, seen</string>
                    <string>as a whole. 5 Faith has accepted every aspect of the situation, and faithlessness has not forced any</string>
                    <string>exclusion on it. 6 It is a situation of perfect peace, simply because you have let it be what it is.</string>

                    <string>T-17.VIII.2. This simple courtesy is all the Holy Spirit asks of you. 2 Let truth be what it is. 3 Do</string>
                    <string>not intrude upon it, do not attack it, do not interrupt its coming. 4 Let it encompass every situation</string>
                    <string>and bring you peace. 5 Not even faith is asked of you, for truth asks nothing. 6 Let it enter, and it</string>
                    <string>will call forth and secure for you the faith you need for peace. 7 But rise you not against it, for</string>
                    <string>against your opposition it cannot come.</string>

                    <string>T-17.VIII.3. Would you not want to make a holy instant of every situation? 2 For such is the gift of</string>
                    <string>faith, freely given wherever faithlessness is laid aside, unused. 3 And then the power of the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit's purpose is free to use instead. 4 This power instantly transforms all situations into one sure</string>
                    <string>and continuous means for establishing His purpose, and demonstrating its reality. 5 What has been</string>
                    <string>demonstrated has called for faith, and has been given it. 6 Now it becomes a fact, from which faith</string>
                    <string>can no longer be withheld. 7 The strain of refusing faith to truth is enormous, and far greater than</string>
                    <string>you realize. 8 But to answer truth with faith entails no strain at all.</string>

                    <string>responding to His Call seems to be greater than before. 2 This is not so. 3 Before, the strain was</string>
                    <string>there, but you attributed it to something else, believing that the "something else" produced it. 4 This</string>
                    <string>was never true. 5 For what the "something else" produced was sorrow and depression, sickness and</string>
                    <string>pain, darkness and dim imaginings of terror, cold fantasies of fear and fiery dreams of hell. 6 And it</string>
                    <string>was nothing but the intolerable strain of refusing to give faith to truth, and see its evident reality.</string>

                    <string>carefully before you let yourself use faithlessness against him. 4 For he is risen, and you have</string>
                    <string>accepted the Cause of his awakening as yours. 5 You have assumed your part in his redemption, and</string>
                    <string>you are now fully responsible to him. 6 Fail him not now, for it has been given you to realize what</string>
                    <string>your lack of faith in him must mean to you. 7 His salvation is your only purpose. 8 See only this in</string>

                    <string>its conditions, and you had faith in it for no one accepts what he does not believe is real. 3 Your</string>
                    <string>purpose has not changed, and will not change, for you accepted what can never change. 4 And</string>
                    <string>nothing that it needs to be forever changeless can you now withhold from it. 5 Your release is</string>
                    <string>certain. 6 Give as you have received. 7 And demonstrate that you have risen far beyond any</string>

                    <string>T-18.I.1. To substitute is to accept instead. 2 If you would but consider exactly what this entails,</string>
                    <string>you would perceive at once how much at variance this is with the goal the Holy Spirit has given</string>
                    <string>you, and would accomplish for you. 3 To substitute is to choose between, renouncing one aspect of</string>
                    <string>the Sonship in favor of the other. 4 For this special purpose, one is judged more valuable and the</string>
                    <string>other is replaced by him. 5 The relationship in which the substitution occurred is thus fragmented,</string>
                    <string>and its purpose split accordingly. 6 To fragment is to exclude, and substitution is the strongest</string>
                    <string>defense the ego has for separation.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-18.I.2. The Holy Spirit never uses substitutes. 2 Where the ego perceives one person as a</string>
                    <string>replacement for another, the Holy Spirit sees them joined and indivisible. 3 He does not judge</string>
                    <string>between them, knowing they are one. 4 Being united, they are one because they are the same. 5</string>
                    <string>Substitution is clearly a process in which they are perceived as different. 6 One would unite; the</string>
                    <string>other separate. 7 Nothing can come between what God has joined and what the Holy Spirit sees as</string>
                    <string>one. 8 But everything seems to come between the fragmented relationships the ego sponsors to</string>
                    <string>destroy.</string>

                    <string>T-18.I.3. The one emotion in which substitution is impossible is love. 2 Fear involves substitution</string>
                    <string>by definition, for it is love's replacement. 3 Fear is both a fragmented and fragmenting emotion. 4 It</string>
                    <string>seems to take many forms, and each one seems to require a different form of acting out for</string>
                    <string>satisfaction. 5 While this appears to introduce quite variable behavior, a far more serious effect lies</string>
                    <string>in the fragmented perception from which the behavior stems. 6 No one is seen complete. 7 The body</string>
                    <string>is emphasized, with special emphasis on certain parts, and used as the standard for comparison of</string>
                    <string>acceptance or rejection for acting out a special form of fear.</string>

                    <string>T-18.I.4. You who believe that God is fear made but one substitution. 2 It has taken many forms,</string>
                    <string>because it was the substitution of illusion for truth; of fragmentation for wholeness. 3 It has become</string>
                    <string>so splintered and subdivided and divided again, over and over, that it is now almost impossible to</string>
                    <string>perceive it once was one, and still is what it was. 4 That one error, which brought truth to illusion,</string>
                    <string>infinity to time, and life to death, was all you ever made. 5 Your whole world rests upon it. 6</string>
                    <string>Everything you see reflects it, and every special relationship that you have ever made is part of it.</string>

                    <string>T-18.I.5. You may be surprised to hear how very different is reality from what you see. 2 You do</string>
                    <string>not realize the magnitude of that one error. 3 It was so vast and so completely incredible that from it</string>
                    <string>a world of total unreality had to emerge. 4 What else could come of it? 5 Its fragmented aspects are</string>
                    <string>fearful enough, as you begin to look at them. 6 But nothing you have seen begins to show you the</string>
                    <string>enormity of the original error, which seemed to cast you out of Heaven, to shatter knowledge into</string>
                    <string>meaningless bits of disunited perceptions, and to force you to make further substitutions.</string>

                    <string>T-18.I.6. That was the first projection of error outward. 2 The world arose to hide it, and became the</string>
                    <string>screen on which it was projected and drawn between you and the truth. 3 For truth extends inward,</string>
                    <string>where the idea of loss is meaningless and only increase is conceivable. 4 Do you really think it</string>
                    <string>strange that a world in which everything is backwards and upside down arose from this projection</string>
                    <string>of error? 5 It was inevitable. 6 For truth brought to this could only remain within in quiet, and take</string>
                    <string>no part in all the mad projection by which this world was made. 7 Call it not sin but madness, for</string>
                    <string>such it was and so it still remains. 8 Invest it not with guilt, for guilt implies it was accomplished in</string>
                    <string>reality. 9 And above all, be not afraid of it .</string>

                    <string>only, "God is not fear, but Love," and it will disappear. 2 The truth will save you. 3 It has not left</string>
                    <string>you, to go out into the mad world and so depart from you. 4 Inward is sanity; insanity is outside</string>
                    <string>you. 5 You but believe it is the other way; that truth is outside, and error and guilt within. 6 Your</string>
                    <string>little, senseless substitutions, touched with insanity and swirling lightly off on a mad course like</string>
                    <string>feathers dancing insanely in the wind, have no substance. 7 They fuse and merge and separate, in</string>
                    <string>shifting and totally meaningless patterns that need not be judged at all. 8 To judge them individually</string>
                    <string>is pointless. 9 Their tiny differences in form are no real differences at all. 10 None of them matters.</string>
                    <string>11 That they have in common and nothing else. 12 Yet what else is necessary to make them all the</string>

                    <string>far, far outside of you. 2 And turn you to the stately calm within, where in holy stillness dwells the</string>
                    <string>living God you never left, and Who never left you. 3 The Holy Spirit takes you gently by the hand,</string>
                    <string>and retraces with you your mad journey outside yourself, leading you gently back to the truth and</string>
                    <string>safety within. 4 He brings all your insane projections and the wild substitutions that you have placed</string>
                    <string>outside you to the truth. 5 Thus He reverses the course of insanity and restores you to reason.</string>

                    <string>It is clearly not the world you saw before you slept. 4 Rather it is a distortion of the world, planned</string>
                    <string>solely around what you would have preferred. 5 Here, you are "free" to make over whatever seemed</string>
                    <string>to attack you, and change it into a tribute to your ego, which was outraged by the "attack." 6 This</string>
                    <string>would not be your wish unless you saw yourself as one with the ego, which always looks upon</string>
                    <string>itself, and therefore on you, as under attack and highly vulnerable to it.</string>

                    <string>they have no concern with what is true. 2 They are the best example you could have of how</string>
                    <string>perception can be utilized to substitute illusions for truth. 3 You do not take them seriously on</string>
                    <string>awaking because the fact that reality is so outrageously violated in them becomes apparent. 4 Yet</string>
                    <string>they are a way of looking at the world, and changing it to suit the ego better. 5 They provide</string>
                    <string>striking examples, both of the ego's inability to tolerate reality, and of your willingness to change</string>

                    <string>them be, and what they do you order. 6 No limits on substitution are laid upon you. 7 For a time it</string>
                    <string>seems as if the world were given you, to make it what you wish. 8 You do not realize you are</string>

                    <string>and in an instant the illusion of satisfaction is invaded by the illusion of terror. 5 For the dream of</string>
                    <string>your ability to control reality by substituting a world that you prefer is terrifying. 6 Your attempts to</string>
                    <string>blot out reality are very fearful, but this you are not willing to accept. 7 And so you substitute the</string>
                    <string>fantasy that reality is fearful, not what you would do to it. 8 And thus is guilt made real.</string>

                    <string>that because you want it you see it. 2 And while you see it you do not doubt that it is real. 3 Yet here</string>
                    <string>is a world, clearly within your mind, that seems to be outside. 4 You do not respond to it as though</string>
                    <string>you made it, nor do you realize that the emotions the dream produces must come from you. 5 It is</string>
                    <string>the figures in the dream and what they do that seem to make the dream. 6 You do not realize that</string>
                    <string>you are making them act out for you, for if you did the guilt would not be theirs, and the illusion of</string>
                    <string>satisfaction would be gone. 7 In dreams these features are not obscure. 8 You seem to waken, and</string>
                    <string>the dream is gone. 9 Yet what you fail to recognize is that what caused the dream has not gone with</string>
                    <string>it. 10 Your wish to make another world that is not real remains with you. 11 And what you seem to</string>
                    <string>waken to is but another form of this same world you see in dreams. 12 All your time is spent in</string>
                    <string>dreaming. 13 Your sleeping and your waking dreams have different forms, and that is all. 14 Their</string>
                    <string>content is the same. 15 They are your protest against reality, and your fixed and insane idea that you</string>
                    <string>can change it. 16 In your waking dreams, the special relationship has a special place. 17 It is the</string>
                    <string>means by which you try to make your sleeping dreams come true. 18 From this, you do not waken.</string>
                    <string>The special relationship is your determination to keep your hold on unreality, and to prevent</string>
                    <string>yourself from waking. And while you see more value in sleeping than in waking, you will not let go</string>

                    <string>change, before dreams disappear, is that your dreams of fear are changed to happy dreams. 4 That is</string>
                    <string>what the Holy Spirit does in the special relationship. 5 He does not destroy it, nor snatch it away</string>
                    <string>from you. 6 But He does use it differently, as a help to make His purpose real to you. 7 The special</string>
                    <string>relationship will remain, not as a source of pain and guilt, but as a source of joy and freedom. 8 It</string>
                    <string>will not be for you alone, for therein lay its misery. 9 As its unholiness kept it a thing apart, its</string>

                    <string>Think not that He has forgotten anyone in the purpose He has given you. 5 And think not that He</string>
                    <string>has forgotten you to whom He gave the gift. 6 He uses everyone who calls on Him as means for the</string>
                    <string>salvation of everyone. 7 And He will waken everyone through you who offered your relationship to</string>
                    <string>Him. 8 If you but recognized His gratitude! 9 Or mine through His! 10 For we are joined as in one</string>

                    <string>brother has now become one in which the wish has been removed, because its purpose has been</string>

                    <string>this that is the dream. 6 You are so used to choosing among dreams you do not see that you have</string>

                    <string>into the darkness but made the darkness deeper. 4 Your goal was darkness, in which no ray of light</string>
                    <string>could enter. 5 And you sought a blackness so complete that you could hide from truth forever, in</string>
                    <string>complete insanity. 6 What you forgot was simply that God cannot destroy Himself. 7 The light is in</string>

                    <string>your goal is the advance from fear to truth. 3 The goal you accepted is the goal of knowledge, for</string>
                    <string>which you signified your willingness. 4 Fear seems to live in darkness, and when you are afraid you</string>
                    <string>have stepped back. 5 Let us then join quickly in an instant of light, and it will be enough to remind</string>

                    <string>journey into darkness has been long and cruel, and you have gone deep into it. 4 A little flicker of</string>
                    <string>your eyelids, closed so long, has not yet been sufficient to give you confidence in yourself, so long</string>
                    <string>despised. 5 You go toward love still hating it, and terribly afraid of its judgment upon you. 6 And</string>
                    <string>you do not realize that you are not afraid of love, but only of what you have made of it. 7 You are</string>
                    <string>advancing to love's meaning, and away from all illusions in which you have surrounded it. 8 When</string>
                    <string>you retreat to the illusion your fear increases, for there is little doubt that what you think it means is</string>
                    <string>fearful. 9 Yet what is that to us who travel surely and very swiftly away from fear?</string>

                    <string>now in complete accord with all the power of the Holy Spirit's Will. 4 No little, faltering footsteps</string>
                    <string>that you may take can separate your desire from His Will and from His strength. 5 I hold your hand</string>

                    <string>simple willingness to make way for it. 7 Purification is of God alone, and therefore for you. 8 Rather</string>
                    <string>than seek to prepare yourself for Him, try to think thus: 9 I who am host to God am worthy of Him.</string>
                    <string>10 He Who established His dwelling place in me created it as He would have it be. 11 It is not</string>

                    <string>my own awareness of my readiness, which is eternal. 12 I need add nothing to His plan. 13 But to</string>

                    <string>You are still convinced that your understanding is a powerful contribution to the truth, and makes it</string>
                    <string>what it is. 6 Yet we have emphasized that you need understand nothing. 7 Salvation is easy just</string>

                    <string>accomplished, would have no purpose. 4 For they are all but aspects of the plan to change your</string>

                    <string>remove all fear and hatred, and to be forgiven. 6 On your little faith, joined with His understanding,</string>
                    <string>He will build your part in the Atonement and make sure that you fulfill it easily. 7 And with Him,</string>
                    <string>you will build a ladder planted in the solid rock of faith, and rising even to Heaven. 8 Nor will you</string>

                    <string>Mind about it. 6 The means and purpose both belong to Him. 7 You have accepted one; the other</string>
                    <string>will be provided. 8 A purpose such as this, without the means, is inconceivable. 9 He will provide</string>

                    <string>because it is attacked to hold the separation in the mind, and let it not know its Identity. 5 Mind</string>

                    <string>this "transportation" really entails, you will realize that it is a sudden unawareness of the body, and a</string>

                    <string>What really happens is that you have given up the illusion of a limited awareness, and lost your fear</string>

                    <string>you slip past centuries of effort, and escape from time. 4 This is the way in which sin loses all</string>
                    <string>attraction right now. 5 For here is time denied, and past and future gone. 6 Who needs do nothing</string>
                    <string>has no need for time. 7 To do nothing is to rest, and make a place within you where the activity of</string>
                    <string>the body ceases to demand attention. 8 Into this place the Holy Spirit comes, and there abides. 9 He</string>
                    <string>will remain when you forget, and the body's activities return to occupy your conscious mind.</string>

                    <string>truth as its only goal is brought to truth by faith. 4 This faith encompasses everyone involved, for</string>
                    <string>only thus the situation is perceived as meaningful and as a whole. 5 And everyone must be involved</string>

                    <string>And he is healed because you offered faith to him, giving him to the Holy Spirit and releasing him</string>
                    <string>from every demand your ego would make of him. 3 Thus do you see him free, and in this vision</string>
                    <string>does the Holy Spirit share. 4 And since He shares it He has given it, and so He heals through you. 5</string>
                    <string>It is this joining Him in a united purpose that makes this purpose real, because you make it whole. 6</string>
                    <string>And this is healing. 7 The body is healed because you came without it, and joined the Mind in which</string>

                    <string>or sickness depends entirely on how the mind perceives it, and the purpose that the mind would use</string>
                    <string>it for. 4 It is obvious that a segment of the mind can see itself as separated from the Universal</string>
                    <string>Purpose. 5 When this occurs the body becomes its weapon, used against this Purpose, to</string>
                    <string>demonstrate the "fact" that separation has occurred. 6 The body thus becomes the instrument of</string>
                    <string>illusion, acting accordingly; seeing what is not there, hearing what truth has never said and behaving</string>
                    <string>insanely, being imprisoned by insanity.</string>

                    <string>T-19.I.4. Do not overlook our earlier statement that faithlessness leads straight to illusions. 2 For</string>
                    <string>faithlessness is the perception of a brother as a body, and the body cannot be used for purposes of</string>
                    <string>union. 3 If, then, you see your brother as a body, you have established a condition in which uniting</string>
                    <string>with him becomes impossible. 4 Your faithlessness to him has separated you from him, and kept you</string>
                    <string>both apart from being healed. 5 Your faithlessness has thus opposed the Holy Spirit's purpose, and</string>
                    <string>brought illusions, centered on the body, to stand between you. 6 And the body will seem to be sick,</string>
                    <string>for you have made of it an "enemy" of healing and the opposite of truth.</string>

                    <string>T-19.I.5. It cannot be difficult to realize that faith must be the opposite of faithlessness. 2 Yet the</string>
                    <string>difference in how they operate is less apparent, though it follows directly from the fundamental</string>
                    <string>difference in what they are. 3 Faithlessness would always limit and attack; faith would remove all</string>
                    <string>limitations and make whole. 4 Faithlessness would destroy and separate; faith would unite and heal.</string>
                    <string>5 Faithlessness would interpose illusions between the Son of God and his Creator; faith would</string>
                    <string>remove all obstacles that seem to rise between them. 6 Faithlessness is wholly dedicated to illusions;</string>
                    <string>faith wholly to truth. 7 Partial dedication is impossible. 8 Truth is the absence of illusion; illusion</string>
                    <string>the absence of truth. 9 Both cannot be together, nor perceived in the same place. 10 To dedicate</string>
                    <string>yourself to both is to set up a goal forever impossible to attain, for part of it is sought through the</string>
                    <string>body, thought of as a means for seeking out reality through attack. 11 The other part would heal, and</string>
                    <string>therefore calls upon the mind and not the body.</string>

                    <string>T-19.I.6. The inevitable compromise is the belief that the body must be healed, and not the mind. 2</string>
                    <string>For this divided goal has given both an equal reality, which could be possible only if the mind is</string>
                    <string>limited to the body and divided into little parts of seeming wholeness, but without connection. 3</string>
                    <string>This will not harm the body, but it will keep the delusional thought system in the mind. 4 Here, then,</string>
                    <string>is healing needed. 5 And it is here that healing is. 6 For God gave healing not apart from sickness,</string>
                    <string>nor established remedy where sickness cannot be. 7 They are together, and when they are seen</string>
                    <string>together, all attempts to keep both truth and illusion in the mind, where both must be, are</string>
                    <string>recognized as dedication to illusion; and given up when brought to truth, and seen as totally</string>
                    <string>unreconcilable with truth, in any respect or in any way.</string>

                    <string>seek to connect them. 3 But illusions are always connected, as is truth. 4 Each is united, a complete</string>
                    <string>thought system, but totally disconnected to each other. 5 And to perceive this is to recognize where</string>
                    <string>separation is, and where it must be healed. 6 The result of an idea is never separate from its source.</string>
                    <string>7 The idea of separation produced the body and remains connected to it, making it sick because of</string>
                    <string>the mind's identification with it. 8 You think you are protecting the body by hiding this connection,</string>
                    <string>for this concealment seems to keep your identification safe from the "attack" of truth.</string>

                    <string>its results. 3 For by withholding faith you see what is unworthy of it, and cannot look beyond the</string>

                    <string>and would therefore share it. 3 By faith, you offer the gift of freedom from the past, which you</string>
                    <string>received. 4 You do not use anything your brother has done before to condemn him now. 5 You</string>
                    <string>freely choose to overlook his errors, looking past all barriers between yourself and him, and seeing</string>
                    <string>them as one. 6 And in that one you see your faith is fully justified. 7 There is no justification for</string>

                    <string>T-19.I.10. Faith is the opposite of fear, as much a part of love as fear is of attack. 2 Faith is the</string>
                    <string>acknowledgment of union. 3 It is the gracious acknowledgment of everyone as a Son of your most</string>
                    <string>loving Father, loved by Him like you, and therefore loved by you as yourself. 4 It is His Love that</string>
                    <string>joins you and your brother, and for His Love you would keep no one separate from yours. 5 Each</string>
                    <string>one appears just as he is perceived in the holy instant, united in your purpose to be released from</string>
                    <string>guilt. 6 You see the Christ in him, and he is healed because you look on what makes faith forever</string>
                    <string>justified in everyone.</string>

                    <string>T-19.I.11. Faith is the gift of God, through Him Whom God has given you. 2 Faithlessness looks</string>
                    <string>upon the Son of God, and judges him unworthy of forgiveness. 3 But through the eyes of faith, the</string>
                    <string>Son of God is seen already forgiven, free of all the guilt he laid upon himself. 4 Faith sees him only</string>
                    <string>now because it looks not to the past to judge him, but would see in him only what it would see in</string>
                    <string>you. 5 It sees not through the body's eyes, nor looks to bodies for its justification. 6 It is the</string>
                    <string>messenger of the new perception, sent forth to gather witnesses unto its coming, and to return their</string>

                    <string>the Holy Spirit's perception, and is the sign you share it with Him. 3 Faith is a gift you offer to the</string>
                    <string>Son of God through Him, and wholly acceptable to his Father as to Him. 4 And therefore offered</string>
                    <string>you. 5 Your holy relationship, with its new purpose, offers you faith to give unto your brother. 6</string>
                    <string>Your faithlessness has driven you and him apart, and so you do not recognize salvation in him. 7</string>
                    <string>Yet faith unites you in the holiness you see, not through the body's eyes, but in the sight of Him</string>

                    <string>instantly beyond the body, and sees the holy place where it was healed. 3 There is the altar where</string>
                    <string>the grace was given, in which it stands. 4 Do you, then, offer grace and blessing to your brother, for</string>
                    <string>you stand at the same altar where grace was laid for both of you. 5 And be you healed by grace</string>

                    <string>Himself and both of you. 2 Lay faithlessness aside, and come to it together. 3 There will you see the</string>
                    <string>miracle of your relationship as it was made again through faith. 4 And there it is that you will realize</string>
                    <string>that there is nothing faith cannot forgive. 5 No error interferes with its calm sight, which brings the</string>
                    <string>miracle of healing with equal ease to all of them. 6 For what the messengers of love are sent to do</string>
                    <string>they do, returning the glad tidings that it was done to you and your brother who stand together</string>

                    <string>Holy Spirit prepare the ground for the most holy garden that He would make of it. 2 For faith brings</string>
                    <string>peace, and so it calls on truth to enter and make lovely what has already been prepared for</string>
                    <string>loveliness. 3 Truth follows faith and peace, completing the process of making lovely that they begin.</string>
                    <string>4 For faith is still a learning goal, no longer needed when the lesson has been learned. 5 Yet truth</string>

                    <string>T-19.II.1. It is essential that error be not confused with sin, and it is this distinction that makes</string>
                    <string>salvation possible. 2 For error can be corrected, and the wrong made right. 3 But sin, were it</string>
                    <string>possible, would be irreversible. 4 The belief in sin is necessarily based on the firm conviction that</string>
                    <string>minds, not bodies, can attack. 5 And thus the mind is guilty, and will forever so remain unless a</string>
                    <string>mind not part of it can give it absolution. 6 Sin calls for punishment as error for correction, and the</string>
                    <string>belief that punishment is correction is clearly insane.</string>

                    <string>T-19.II.2. Sin is not an error, for sin entails an arrogance which the idea of error lacks. 2 To sin</string>
                    <string>would be to violate reality, and to succeed. 3 Sin is the proclamation that attack is real and guilt is</string>
                    <string>justified. 4 It assumes the Son of God is guilty, and has thus succeeded in losing his innocence and</string>
                    <string>making himself what God created not. 5 Thus is creation seen as not eternal, and the Will of God</string>
                    <string>open to opposition and defeat. 6 Sin is the grand illusion underlying all the ego's grandiosity. 7 For</string>
                    <string>by it God Himself is changed, and rendered incomplete.</string>

                    <string>T-19.II.3. The Son of God can be mistaken; he can deceive himself; he can even turn the power of</string>
                    <string>his mind against himself. 2 But he cannot sin. 3 There is nothing he can do that would really change</string>
                    <string>his reality in any way, nor make him really guilty. 4 That is what sin would do, for such is its</string>
                    <string>purpose. 5 Yet for all the wild insanity inherent in the whole idea of sin, it is impossible. 6 For the</string>
                    <string>wages of sin is death, and how can the immortal die?</string>

                    <string>T-19.II.4. A major tenet in the ego's insane religion is that sin is not error but truth, and it is</string>
                    <string>innocence that would deceive. 2 Purity is seen as arrogance, and the acceptance of the self as sinful</string>
                    <string>is perceived as holiness. 3 And it is this doctrine that replaces the reality of the Son of God as his</string>
                    <string>Father created him, and willed that he be forever. 4 Is this humility? 5 Or is it, rather, an attempt to</string>
                    <string>wrest creation away from truth, and keep it separate?</string>

                    <string>T-19.II.5. Any attempt to reinterpret sin as error is always indefensible to the ego. 2 The idea of sin</string>
                    <string>is wholly sacrosanct to its thought system, and quite unapproachable except with reverence and awe.</string>
                    <string>3 It is the most "holy" concept in the ego's system; lovely and powerful, wholly true, and necessarily</string>
                    <string>protected with every defense at its disposal. 4 For here lies its "best" defense, which all the others</string>
                    <string>serve. 5 Here is its armor, its protection, and the fundamental purpose of the special relationship in</string>
                    <string>its interpretation.</string>

                    <string>T-19.II.6. It can indeed be said the ego made its world on sin. 2 Only in such a world could</string>
                    <string>everything be upside down. 3 This is the strange illusion that makes the clouds of guilt seem heavy</string>
                    <string>and impenetrable. 4 The solidness that this world's foundation seems to have is found in this. 5 For</string>
                    <string>sin has changed creation from an idea of God to an ideal the ego wants; a world it rules, made up of</string>
                    <string>bodies, mindless and capable of complete corruption and decay. 6 If this is a mistake, it can be</string>
                    <string>undone easily by truth. 7 Any mistake can be corrected, if truth be left to judge it. 8 But if the</string>
                    <string>mistake is given the status of truth, to what can it be brought? 9 The "holiness" of sin is kept in</string>
                    <string>place by just this strange device. 10 As truth it is inviolate, and everything is brought to it for</string>
                    <string>judgment. 11 As a mistake, it must be brought to truth. 12 It is impossible to have faith in sin, for</string>
                    <string>sin is faithlessness. 13 Yet it is possible to have faith that a mistake can be corrected.</string>

                    <string>idea that sin is real; the natural expression of what the Son of God has made himself to be, and what</string>
                    <string>he is. 2 To the ego, this is no mistake. 3 For this is its reality; this is the "truth" from which escape</string>
                    <string>will always be impossible. 4 This is his past, his present and his future. 5 For he has somehow</string>
                    <string>managed to corrupt his Father, and change His Mind completely. 6 Mourn, then, the death of God,</string>
                    <string>Whom sin has killed! 7 And this would be the ego's wish, which in its madness it believes it has</string>

                    <string>For that is all it is. 3 Perhaps you would be tempted to agree with the ego that it is far better to be</string>
                    <string>sinful than mistaken. 4 Yet think you carefully before you allow yourself to make this choice. 5</string>

                    <string>T-19.III.1. The attraction of guilt is found in sin, not error. 2 Sin will be repeated because of this</string>
                    <string>attraction. 3 Fear can become so acute that the sin is denied the acting out. 4 But while the guilt</string>
                    <string>remains attractive the mind will suffer, and not let go of the idea of sin. 5 For guilt still calls to it,</string>
                    <string>and the mind hears it and yearns for it, making itself a willing captive to its sick appeal. 6 Sin is an</string>
                    <string>idea of evil that cannot be corrected, and yet will be forever desirable. 7 As an essential part of what</string>
                    <string>the ego thinks you are, you will always want it. 8 And only an avenger, with a mind unlike your</string>
                    <string>own, could stamp it out through fear.</string>

                    <string>always answers. 2 For the ego brings sin to fear, demanding punishment. 3 Yet punishment is but</string>
                    <string>another form of guilt's protection, for what is deserving punishment must have been really done. 4</string>
                    <string>Punishment is always the great preserver of sin, treating it with respect and honoring its enormity. 5</string>
                    <string>What must be punished, must be true. 6 And what is true must be eternal, and will be repeated</string>
                    <string>endlessly. 7 For what you think is real you want, and will not let it go.</string>

                    <string>want corrected. 3 Sometimes a sin can be repeated over and over, with obviously distressing results,</string>
                    <string>but without the loss of its appeal. 4 And suddenly, you change its status from a sin to a mistake. 5</string>
                    <string>Now you will not repeat it; you will merely stop and let it go, unless the guilt remains. 6 For then</string>
                    <string>you will but change the form of sin, granting that it was an error, but keeping it uncorrectable. 7</string>
                    <string>This is not really a change in your perception, for it is sin that calls for punishment, not error.</string>

                    <string>correction, and they call for nothing else. 6 What calls for punishment must call for nothing. 7 Every</string>
                    <string>mistake must be a call for love. 8 What, then, is sin? 9 What could it be but a mistake you would</string>

                    <string>T-19.III.5. In time, the Holy Spirit clearly sees the Son of God can make mistakes. 2 On this you</string>

                    <string>4 And when correction is completed, time is eternity. 5 The Holy Spirit can teach you how to look</string>

                    <string>impossible that what is part of Him is totally unlike the rest. 3 If sin is real, God must be at war with</string>
                    <string>Himself. 4 He must be split, and torn between good and evil; partly sane and partially insane. 5 For</string>

                    <string>T-19.IV.A.10. i. The Attraction of Guilt The attraction of guilt produces fear of love, for love would</string>
                    <string>never look on guilt at all. 2 It is the nature of love to look upon only the truth, for there it sees itself,</string>
                    <string>with which it would unite in holy union and completion. 3 As love must look past fear, so must fear</string>
                    <string>see love not. 4 For love contains the end of guilt, as surely as fear depends on it. 5 Love is attracted</string>
                    <string>only to love. 6 Overlooking guilt completely, it sees no fear. 7 Being wholly without attack, it could</string>
                    <string>not be afraid. 8 Fear is attracted to what love sees not, and each believes that what the other looks</string>
                    <string>upon does not exist. 9 Fear looks on guilt with just the same devotion that love looks on itself. 10</string>
                    <string>And each has messengers which it sends forth, and which return to it with messages written in the</string>
                    <string>language in which their going forth was asked.</string>

                    <string>2 The messengers of fear are harshly ordered to seek out guilt, and cherish every scrap of evil and</string>
                    <string>of sin that they can find, losing none of them on pain of death, and laying them respectfully before</string>
                    <string>their lord and master. 3 Perception cannot obey two masters, each asking for messages of different</string>
                    <string>things in different languages. 4 What fear would feed upon, love overlooks. 5 What fear demands,</string>
                    <string>love cannot even see. 6 The fierce attraction that guilt holds for fear is wholly absent from love's</string>
                    <string>gentle perception. 7 What love would look upon is meaningless to fear, and quite invisible.</string>

                    <string>word of what they saw. 3 Fear's messengers are trained through terror, and they tremble when their</string>
                    <string>master calls on them to serve him. 4 For fear is merciless even to its friends. 5 Its messengers steal</string>
                    <string>guiltily away in hungry search of guilt, for they are kept cold and starving and made very vicious by</string>
                    <string>their master, who allows them to feast only upon what they return to him. 6 No little shred of guilt</string>
                    <string>escapes their hungry eyes. 7 And in their savage search for sin they pounce on any living thing they</string>
                    <string>see, and carry it screaming to their master, to be devoured.</string>

                    <string>such things are beautiful, because they seem to allay their savage pangs of hunger. 5 For they are</string>

                    <string>send them forth, they will see only the blameless and the beautiful, the gentle and the kind. 4 They</string>
                    <string>will be as careful to let no little act of charity, no tiny expression of forgiveness, no little breath of</string>

                    <string>lovingly with you. 6 Be not afraid of them. 7 They offer you salvation. 8 Theirs are the messages of</string>

                    <string>have been given to replace the hungry dogs of fear you sent instead. 7 And they go forth to signify</string>

                    <string>2 For I became the symbol of your sin, and so I had to die instead of you. 3 To the ego sin means</string>
                    <string>death, and so atonement is achieved through murder. 4 Salvation is looked upon as a way by which</string>
                    <string>the Son of God was killed instead of you. 5 Yet would I offer you my body, you whom I love,</string>
                    <string>knowing its littleness? 6 Or would I teach that bodies cannot keep us apart? 11 7 Mine was of no</string>
                    <string>greater value than yours; no better means for communication of salvation, but not its Source. 8 No</string>
                    <string>one can die for anyone, and death does not atone for sin. 9 But you can live to show it is not real. 10</string>
                    <string>The body does appear to be the symbol of sin while you believe that it can get you what you want.</string>
                    <string>11 While you believe that it can give you pleasure, you will also believe that it can bring you pain.</string>
                    <string>12 To think you could be satisfied and happy with so little is to hurt yourself, and to limit the</string>
                    <string>happiness that you would have calls upon pain to fill your meager store and make your life</string>
                    <string>complete. 13 This is completion as the ego sees it. 14 For guilt creeps in where happiness has been</string>
                    <string>removed, and substitutes for it. 15 Communion is another kind of completion, which goes beyond</string>
                    <string>guilt, because it goes beyond the body.</string>

                    <string>or a release? 6 What has the body really given you that justifies your strange belief that in it lies</string>

                    <string>removed from what can suffer? 5 The Holy Spirit does not demand you sacrifice the hope of the</string>
                    <string>body's pleasure; it has no hope of pleasure. 6 But neither can it bring you fear of pain. 7 Pain is the</string>

                    <string>T-19.IV.C.11. When anything seems to you to be a source of fear, when any situation strikes you</string>
                    <string>with terror and makes your body tremble and the cold sweat of fear comes over it, remember it is</string>
                    <string>always for one reason; the ego has perceived it as a symbol of fear, a sign of sin and death. 2</string>
                    <string>Remember, then, that neither sign nor symbol should be confused with source, for they must stand</string>
                    <string>for something other than themselves. 3 Their meaning cannot lie in them, but must be sought in</string>
                    <string>what they represent. 4 And they may thus mean everything or nothing, according to the truth or</string>
                    <string>falsity of the idea which they reflect. 5 Confronted with such seeming uncertainty of meaning, judge</string>
                    <string>it not. 6 Remember the holy Presence of the One given to you to be the Source of judgment. 7 Give</string>
                    <string>it to Him to judge for you, and say: 8 Take this from me and look upon it, judging it for me. 9 Let</string>
                    <string>me not see it as a sign of sin and death, nor use it for destruction. 10 Teach me how not to make of</string>
                    <string>it an obstacle to peace, but let You use it for me, to facilitate its coming.</string>

                    <string>death? 2 What would you feel and think if death held no attraction for you? 3 Very simply, you</string>
                    <string>would remember your Father. 4 The Creator of life, the Source of everything that lives, the Father of</string>
                    <string>the universe and of the universe of universes, and of everything that lies even beyond them would</string>
                    <string>you remember. 5 And as this memory rises in your mind, peace must still surmount a final obstacle,</string>
                    <string>after which is salvation completed, and the Son of God entirely restored to sanity. 6 For here your</string>
                    <string>world does end.</string>

                    <string>2 as His face rises beyond it, shining with joy because He is in His Father's Love, peace will lightly</string>
                    <string>brush the veil aside and run to meet Him, and to join with Him at last. 3 For this dark veil, which</string>
                    <string>seems to make the face of Christ Himself like to a leper's, and the bright Rays of His Father's Love</string>
                    <string>that light His face with glory appear as streams of blood, fades in the blazing light beyond it when</string>
                    <string>the fear of death is gone.</string>

                    <string>The dedication to death and to its sovereignty is but the solemn vow, the promise made in secret to</string>
                    <string>the ego never to lift this veil, not to approach it, nor even to suspect that it is there. 3 This is the</string>
                    <string>secret bargain made with the ego to keep what lies beyond the veil forever blotted out and</string>
                    <string>unremembered. 4 Here is your promise never to allow union to call you out of separation; the great</string>
                    <string>amnesia in which the memory of God seems quite forgotten; the cleavage of your Self from you;--the fear of God, the final step in your dissociation.</string>

                    <string>could you fear but life? 3 It is the attraction of death that makes life seem to be ugly, cruel and</string>
                    <string>tyrannical. 4 You are no more afraid of death than of the ego. 5 These are your chosen friends. 6 For</string>
                    <string>in your secret alliance with them you have agreed never to let the fear of God be lifted, so you could</string>
                    <string>look upon the face of Christ and join Him in His Father.</string>

                    <string>T-19.IV.D.5. Every obstacle that peace must flow across is surmounted in just the same way; the</string>
                    <string>fear that raised it yields to the love beyond, and so the fear is gone. 2 And so it is with this. 3 The</string>
                    <string>desire to get rid of peace and drive the Holy Spirit from you fades in the presence of the quiet</string>
                    <string>recognition that you love Him. 4 The exaltation of the body is given up in favor of the spirit, which</string>
                    <string>you love as you could never love the body. 5 And the appeal of death is lost forever as love's</string>
                    <string>attraction stirs and calls to you. 6 From beyond each of the obstacles to love, Love Itself has called.</string>
                    <string>7 And each has been surmounted by the power of the attraction of what lies beyond. 8 Your wanting</string>
                    <string>fear seemed to be holding them in place. 9 Yet when you heard the Voice of Love beyond them, you</string>
                    <string>answered and they disappeared.</string>

                    <string>look down, remembering your promise to your "friends." 3 The "loveliness" of sin, the delicate</string>
                    <string>appeal of guilt, the "holy" waxen image of death, and the fear of vengeance of the ego you swore in</string>
                    <string>blood not to desert, all rise and bid you not to raise your eyes. 4 For you realize that if you look on</string>
                    <string>this and let the veil be lifted, they will be gone forever. 5 All of your "friends," your "protectors"</string>
                    <string>and your "home" will vanish. 6 Nothing that you remember now will you remember.</string>

                    <string>Look upon it, open-eyed, and you will nevermore believe that you are at the mercy of things beyond</string>
                    <string>you, forces you cannot control, and thoughts that come to you against your will. 5 It is your will to</string>
                    <string>look on this. 6 No mad desire, no trivial impulse to forget again, no stab of fear nor the cold sweat</string>
                    <string>of seeming death can stand against your will. 7 For what attracts you from beyond the veil is also</string>

                    <string>brother. 2 And it was surely not the ego that led you here. 3 No obstacle to peace can be surmounted</string>
                    <string>through its help. 4 It does not open up its secrets, and bid you look on them and go beyond them. 5</string>
                    <string>It would not have you see its weakness, and learn it has no power to keep you from the truth. 6 The</string>

                    <string>could not have reached this far unless his brother walked beside him. 3 And no one would dare to</string>

                    <string>T-19.IV.D.19. Together we will disappear into the Presence beyond the veil, not to be lost but</string>
                    <string>found; not to be seen but known. 2 And knowing, nothing in the plan God has established for</string>
                    <string>salvation will be left undone. 3 This is the journey's purpose, without which is the journey</string>
                    <string>meaningless. 4 Here is the peace of God, given to you eternally by Him. 5 Here is the rest and quiet</string>
                    <string>that you seek, the reason for the journey from its beginning. 6 Heaven is the gift you owe your</string>
                    <string>brother, the debt of gratitude you offer to the Son of God in thanks for what he is, and what his</string>
                    <string>Father created him to be.</string>

                    <string>him so will the gift itself appear to be. 2 As he is seen as either the giver of guilt or of salvation, so</string>
                    <string>will his offering be seen and so received. 3 The crucified give pain because they are in pain. 4 But</string>
                    <string>the redeemed give joy because they have been healed of pain. 5 Everyone gives as he receives, but</string>
                    <string>he must choose what it will be that he receives. 6 And he will recognize his choice by what he</string>
                    <string>gives, and what is given him. 7 Nor is it given anything in hell or Heaven to interfere with his</string>

                    <string>do what he believes is meaningless. 3 What you had faith in still is faithful, and watches over you in</string>
                    <string>faith so gentle yet so strong that it would lift you far beyond the veil, and place the Son of God</string>
                    <string>safely within the sure protection of his Father. 4 Here is the only purpose that gives this world, and</string>
                    <string>the long journey through this world, whatever meaning lies in them. 5 Beyond this, they are</string>
                    <string>meaningless. 6 You and your brother stand together, still without conviction they have a purpose. 7</string>
                    <string>Yet it is given you to see this purpose in your holy Friend, and recognize it as your own.</string>

                    <string>not spend this holy week brooding on the crucifixion of God's Son, but happily in the celebration of</string>
                    <string>his release. 3 For Easter is the sign of peace, not pain. 4 A slain Christ has no meaning. 5 But a</string>
                    <string>risen Christ becomes the symbol of the Son of God's forgiveness on himself; the sign he looks upon</string>

                    <string>T-20.I.2. This week begins with palms and ends with lilies, the white and holy sign the Son of God</string>
                    <string>is innocent. 2 Let no dark sign of crucifixion intervene between the journey and its purpose;</string>
                    <string>between the acceptance of the truth and its expression. 3 This week we celebrate life, not death. 4</string>
                    <string>And we honor the perfect purity of the Son of God, and not his sins. 5 Offer your brother the gift of</string>
                    <string>lilies, not the crown of thorns; the gift of love and not the "gift" of fear. 6 You stand beside your</string>
                    <string>brother, thorns in one hand and lilies in the other, uncertain which to give. 7 Join now with me and</string>
                    <string>throw away the thorns, offering the lilies to replace them. 8 This Easter I would have the gift of</string>
                    <string>your forgiveness offered by you to me, and returned by me to you. 9 We cannot be united in</string>
                    <string>crucifixion and in death. 10 Nor can the resurrection be complete till your forgiveness rests on</string>
                    <string>Christ, along with mine.</string>

                    <string>has undertaken. 2 He started with the sign of victory, the promise of the resurrection, already given</string>
                    <string>him. 3 Let him not wander into the temptation of crucifixion, and delay him there. 4 Help him to go</string>
                    <string>in peace beyond it, with the light of his own innocence lighting his way to his redemption and</string>
                    <string>release. 5 Hold him not back with thorns and nails when his redemption is so near. 6 But let the</string>
                    <string>whiteness of your shining gift of lilies speed him on his way to resurrection.</string>

                    <string>T-20.I.4. Easter is not the celebration of the cost of sin, but of its end. 2 If you see glimpses of the</string>
                    <string>face of Christ behind the veil, looking between the snow-white petals of the lilies you have received</string>
                    <string>and given as your gift, you will behold your brother's face and recognize it. 3 I was a stranger and</string>
                    <string>you took me in, not knowing who I was. 4 Yet for your gift of lilies you will know. 5 In your</string>
                    <string>forgiveness of this stranger, alien to you and yet your ancient Friend, lies his release and your</string>
                    <string>redemption with him. 6 The time of Easter is a time of joy, and not of mourning. 7 Look on your</string>
                    <string>risen Friend, and celebrate his holiness along with me. 8 For Easter is the time of your salvation,</string>
                    <string>along with mine.</string>

                    <string>all the useless things made for its eyes to see. 3 Think on the many offerings made for its pleasure,</string>
                    <string>and remember all these were made to make seem lovely what you hate. 4 Would you employ this</string>
                    <string>hated thing to draw your brother to you, and to attract his body's eyes? 5 Learn you but offer him a</string>
                    <string>crown of thorns, not recognizing it for what it is, and trying to justify your own interpretation of its</string>
                    <string>value by his acceptance. 6 Yet still the gift proclaims his worthlessness to you, as his acceptance</string>

                    <string>neither offer nor accept; hold out nor take. 3 Only the mind can value, and only the mind decides on</string>
                    <string>what it would receive and give. 4 And every gift it offers depends on what it wants. 5 It will adorn</string>
                    <string>its chosen home most carefully, making it ready to receive the gifts it wants by offering them to</string>
                    <string>those who come unto its chosen home, or those it would attract to it. 6 And there they will exchange</string>
                    <string>their gifts, offering and receiving what their minds judge to be worthy of them.</string>

                    <string>home as an altar to himself. 3 No one but seeks to draw to it the worshippers of what he placed</string>
                    <string>upon it, making it worthy of their devotion. 4 And each has set a light upon his altar, that they may</string>
                    <string>see what he has placed upon it and take it for their own. 5 Here is the value that you lay upon your</string>
                    <string>brother and on yourself. 6 Here is your gift to both; your judgment on the Son of God for what he</string>
                    <string>is. 7 Forget not that it is your savior to whom the gift is offered. 8 Offer him thorns and you are</string>
                    <string>crucified. 9 Offer him lilies and it is yourself you free.</string>

                    <string>forgiveness when he offers thorns to me? 3 For he who offers thorns to anyone is against me still,</string>
                    <string>and who is whole without him? 4 Be you his friend for me, that I may be forgiven and you may</string>
                    <string>look upon the Son of God as whole. 5 But look you first upon the altar in your chosen home, and</string>
                    <string>see what you have laid upon it to offer me. 6 If it be thorns whose points gleam sharply in a blood-red light, the body is your chosen home and it is separation that you offer me. 7 And yet the thorns</string>
                    <string>are gone. 8 Look you still closer at them now, and you will see your altar is no longer what it was.</string>

                    <string>and received another sight. 3 Those who accept the Holy Spirit's purpose as their own share also His</string>
                    <string>vision. 4 And what enables Him to see His purpose shine forth from every altar now is yours as</string>
                    <string>well as His. 5 He sees no strangers; only dearly loved and loving friends. 6 He sees no thorns but</string>
                    <string>only lilies, gleaming in the gentle glow of peace that shines on everything He looks upon and loves.</string>

                    <string>yet I cannot use your gift of lilies while you see them not. 4 Nor can you use what I have given</string>
                    <string>unless you share it. 5 The Holy Spirit's vision is no idle gift, no plaything to be tossed about a while</string>
                    <string>and laid aside. 6 Listen and hear this carefully, nor think it but a dream, a careless thought to play</string>
                    <string>with, or a toy you would pick up from time to time and then put by. 7 For if you do, so will it be to</string>

                    <string>become the greatest power for the undoing of illusion that God Himself could give. 6 For what God</string>
                    <string>gave the Holy Spirit, you have received. 7 The Son of God looks unto you for his release. 8 For you</string>
                    <string>have asked for and been given the strength to look upon this final obstacle, and see no thorns nor</string>

                    <string>hear. 6 You heard, but knew not how to look, nor where. 7 And now you know. 8 In you the</string>
                    <string>knowledge lies, ready to be unveiled and freed from all the terror that kept it hidden. 9 There is no</string>
                    <string>fear in love. 10 The song of Easter is the glad refrain the Son of God was never crucified. 11 Let us</string>
                    <string>lift up our eyes together, not in fear but faith. 12 And there will be no fear in us, for in our vision</string>

                    <string>T-20.III.1. The belief in sin is an adjustment. 2 And an adjustment is a change; a shift in perception,</string>
                    <string>or a belief that what was so before has been made different. 3 Every adjustment is therefore a</string>
                    <string>distortion, and calls upon defenses to uphold it against reality. 4 Knowledge requires no adjustments</string>
                    <string>and, in fact, is lost if any shift or change is undertaken. 5 For this reduces it at once to mere</string>
                    <string>perception; a way of looking in which certainty is lost and doubt has entered. 6 To this impaired</string>
                    <string>condition are adjustments necessary, because it is not true. 7 Who need adjust to truth, which calls</string>
                    <string>on only what he is, to understand?</string>

                    <string>T-20.III.2. Adjustments of any kind are of the ego. 2 For it is the ego's fixed belief that all</string>
                    <string>relationships depend upon adjustments, to make of them what it would have them be. 3 Direct</string>
                    <string>relationships, in which there are no interferences, are always seen as dangerous. 4 The ego is the</string>
                    <string>self-appointed mediator of all relationships, making whatever adjustments it deems necessary and</string>
                    <string>interposing them between those who would meet, to keep them separate and prevent their union. 5 It</string>
                    <string>is this studied interference that makes it difficult for you to recognize your holy relationship for</string>
                    <string>what it is.</string>

                    <string>T-20.III.3. The holy do not interfere with truth. 2 They are not afraid of it, for it is within the truth</string>
                    <string>they recognize their holiness, and rejoice at what they see. 3 They look on it directly, without</string>
                    <string>attempting to adjust themselves to it, or it to them. 4 And so they see that it was in them, not</string>
                    <string>deciding first where they would have it be. 5 Their looking merely asks a question, and it is what</string>
                    <string>they see that answers them. 6 You make the world and then adjust to it, and it to you. 7 Nor is there</string>
                    <string>any difference between yourself and it in your perception, which made them both.</string>

                    <string>T-20.III.4. A simple question yet remains, and needs an answer. 2 Do you like what you have</string>
                    <string>made?--a world of murder and attack, through which you thread your timid way through constant</string>
                    <string>dangers, alone and frightened, hoping at most that death will wait a little longer before it overtakes</string>
                    <string>you and you disappear. 3 You made this up. 4 It is a picture of what you think you are; of how you</string>
                    <string>see yourself. 5 A murderer is frightened, and those who kill fear death. 6 All these are but the fearful</string>
                    <string>thoughts of those who would adjust themselves to a world made fearful by their adjustments. 7 And</string>
                    <string>they look out in sorrow from what is sad within, and see the sadness there.</string>

                    <string>eyes? 2 The world you see is but a judgment on yourself. 3 It is not there at all. 4 Yet judgment lays</string>
                    <string>a sentence on it, justifies it and makes it real. 5 Such is the world you see; a judgment on yourself,</string>
                    <string>and made by you. 6 This sickly picture of yourself is carefully preserved by the ego, whose image it</string>
                    <string>is and which it loves, and placed outside you in the world. 7 And to this world must you adjust as</string>
                    <string>long as you believe this picture is outside, and has you at its mercy. 8 This world is merciless, and</string>
                    <string>were it outside you, you should indeed be fearful. 9 Yet it was you who made it merciless, and now</string>
                    <string>if mercilessness seems to look back at you, it can be corrected.</string>

                    <string>with them, just as the world the ego looks upon is like itself. 3 The world the holy see is beautiful</string>
                    <string>because they see their innocence in it. 4 They did not tell it what it was; they did not make</string>
                    <string>adjustments to fit their orders. 5 They gently questioned it and whispered, "What are you?" 6 And</string>
                    <string>He Who watches over all perception answered. 7 Take not the judgment of the world as answer to</string>
                    <string>the question, "What am I?" 8 The world believes in sin, but the belief that made it as you see it is</string>
                    <string>not outside you.</string>

                    <string>T-20.III.7. Seek not to make the Son of God adjust to his insanity. 2 There is a stranger in him, who</string>
                    <string>wandered carelessly into the home of truth and who will wander off. 3 He came without a purpose,</string>
                    <string>but he will not remain before the shining light the Holy Spirit offered, and you accepted. 4 For there</string>
                    <string>the stranger is made homeless and you are welcome. 5 Ask not this transient stranger, "What am I?"</string>
                    <string>6 He is the only thing in all the universe that does not know. 7 Yet it is he you ask, and it is to his</string>
                    <string>answer that you would adjust. 8 This one wild thought, fierce in its arrogance, and yet so tiny and</string>
                    <string>so meaningless it slips unnoticed through the universe of truth, becomes your guide. 9 To it you turn</string>
                    <string>to ask the meaning of the universe. 10 And of the one blind thing in all the seeing universe of truth</string>
                    <string>you ask, "How shall I look upon the Son of God?"</string>

                    <string>T-20.III.8. Does one ask judgment of what is totally bereft of judgment? 2 And if you have, would</string>
                    <string>you believe the answer, and adjust to it as if it were the truth? 3 The world you look on is the</string>
                    <string>answer that it gave you, and you have given it power to adjust the world to make its answer true. 4</string>
                    <string>You asked this puff of madness for the meaning of your unholy relationship, and adjusted it</string>
                    <string>according to its insane answer. 5 How happy did it make you? 6 Did you meet your brother with joy</string>
                    <string>to bless the Son of God, and give him thanks for all the happiness that he held out to you? 7 Did you</string>
                    <string>recognize your brother as the eternal gift of God to you? 8 Did you see the holiness that shone in</string>
                    <string>both you and your brother, to bless the other? 9 That is the purpose of your holy relationship. 10</string>
                    <string>Ask not the means of its attainment of the one thing that still would have it be unholy. 11 Give it no</string>
                    <string>power to adjust the means and end.</string>

                    <string>and with eyes so long cast down in darkness they remember not the light, do not leap up in joy the</string>
                    <string>instant they are made free. 2 It takes a while for them to understand what freedom is. 3 You groped</string>
                    <string>but feebly in the dust and found your brother's hand, uncertain whether to let it go or to take hold on</string>
                    <string>life so long forgotten. 4 Strengthen your hold and raise your eyes unto your strong companion, in</string>
                    <string>whom the meaning of your freedom lies. 5 He seemed to be crucified beside you. 6 And yet his</string>
                    <string>holiness remained untouched and perfect, and with him beside you, you shall this day enter with</string>
                    <string>him to Paradise, and know the peace of God.</string>

                    <string>himself. 2 Here there is only holiness and joining without limit. 3 For what is Heaven but union,</string>
                    <string>direct and perfect, and without the veil of fear upon it? 4 Here are we one, looking with perfect</string>
                    <string>gentleness upon each other and on ourselves. 5 Here all thoughts of any separation between us</string>
                    <string>become impossible. 6 You who were a prisoner in separation are now made free in Paradise. 7 And</string>

                    <string>then, this faith with me, and know that it is justified. 3 There is no fear in perfect love because it</string>
                    <string>knows no sin, and it must look on others as on itself. 4 Looking with charity within, what can it fear</string>
                    <string>without? 5 The innocent see safety, and the pure in heart see God within His Son, and look unto the</string>
                    <string>Son to lead them to the Father. 6 And where else would they go but where they will to be? 7 You</string>
                    <string>and your brother now will lead the other to the Father as surely as God created His Son holy, and</string>
                    <string>kept him so. 8 In your brother is the light of God's eternal promise of your immortality. 9 See him</string>

                    <string>laws of this world interpret giving; as you give you lose. 3 It is not up to you to give power at all. 4</string>
                    <string>Power is of God, given by Him and reawakened by the Holy Spirit, Who knows that as you give you</string>
                    <string>gain. 5 He gives no power to sin, and therefore it has none; nor to its results as this world sees</string>
                    <string>them,--sickness and death and misery and pain. 6 These things have not occurred because the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit sees them not, and gives no power to their seeming source. 7 Thus would He keep you free of</string>
                    <string>them. 8 Being without illusion of what you are, the Holy Spirit merely gives everything to God,</string>
                    <string>Who has already given and received all that is true. 9 The untrue He has neither received nor given.</string>

                    <string>their source. 2 And therein lies your need to see your brother sinless. 3 In him is Heaven. 4 See sin</string>
                    <string>in him instead, and Heaven is lost to you. 5 But see him as he is, and what is yours shines from him</string>
                    <string>to you. 6 Your savior gives you only love, but what you would receive of him is up to you. 7 It lies</string>
                    <string>in him to overlook all your mistakes, and therein lies his own salvation. 8 And so it is with yours. 9</string>
                    <string>Salvation is a lesson in giving, as the Holy Spirit interprets it. 10 It is the reawakening of the laws of</string>
                    <string>God in minds that have established other laws, and given them power to enforce what God created</string>

                    <string>And is it this that you would see within your savior from insanity? 4 He is as free from this as you</string>
                    <string>are, and in the freedom that you see in him you see your own. 5 For this you share. 6 What God has</string>
                    <string>given follows His laws, and His alone. 7 Nor is it possible for those who follow them to suffer the</string>

                    <string>that must be done before the way to peace is open. 2 Perhaps this seems impossible to you. 3 But</string>
                    <string>ask yourself if it is possible that God would have a plan for your salvation that does not work. 4</string>
                    <string>Once you accept His plan as the one function that you would fulfill, there will be nothing else the</string>

                    <string>your path, and leaving in your way no stones to trip on, and no obstacles to bar your way. 6 Nothing</string>
                    <string>you need will be denied you. 7 Not one seeming difficulty but will melt away before you reach it. 8</string>
                    <string>You need take thought for nothing, careless of everything except the only purpose that you would</string>
                    <string>fulfill. 9 As that was given you, so will its fulfillment be. 10 God's guarantee will hold against all</string>
                    <string>obstacles, for it rests on certainty and not contingency. 11 It rests on you. 12 And what can be more</string>

                    <string>T-20.V.1. In this world, God's Son comes closest to himself in a holy relationship. 2 There he</string>
                    <string>begins to find the certainty his Father has in him. 3 And there he finds his function of restoring his</string>
                    <string>Father's laws to what was held outside them, and finding what was lost. 4 Only in time can anything</string>
                    <string>be lost, and never lost forever. 5 So do the parts of God's Son gradually join in time, and with each</string>
                    <string>joining is the end of time brought nearer. 6 Each miracle of joining is a mighty herald of eternity. 7</string>
                    <string>No one who has a single purpose, unified and sure, can be afraid. 8 No one who shares his purpose</string>

                    <string>And in that single heartbeat is the unity of love proclaimed and given welcome. 5 Peace to your</string>
                    <string>holy relationship, which has the power to hold the unity of the Son of God together. 6 You give to</string>
                    <string>your brother for everyone, and in your gift is everyone made glad. 7 Forget not Who has given you</string>
                    <string>the gifts you give, and through your not forgetting this, will you remember Who gave the gifts to</string>

                    <string>clearly cannot be evaluated. 4 Do you recognize the fear that rises from the meaningless attempt to</string>

                    <string>as you receive his Father's gift through him. 4 What is in him will shine so brightly in your grateful</string>
                    <string>vision that you will merely love him and be glad. 5 You will not think to judge him, for who would</string>
                    <string>see the face of Christ and yet insist that judgment still has meaning? 6 For this insistence is of those</string>
                    <string>who do not see. 7 Vision or judgment is your choice, but never both of these.</string>

                    <string>Holy Spirit teaches, it has no function. 3 For minds need not the body to communicate. 4 The sight</string>
                    <string>that sees the body has no use which serves the purpose of a holy relationship. 5 And while you look</string>
                    <string>upon your brother thus, the means and end have not been brought in line. 6 Why should it take so</string>
                    <string>many holy instants to let this be accomplished, when one would do? 7 There is but one. 8 The little</string>
                    <string>breath of eternity that runs through time like golden light is all the same; nothing before it, nothing</string>

                    <string>5 His real relationship is one of perfect union and unbroken continuity. 6 The one he made is partial,</string>
                    <string>self-centered, broken into fragments and full of fear. 7 The one created by his Father is wholly Self-encompassing and Self-extending. 8 The one he made is wholly self-destructive and self-limiting.</string>

                    <string>intrude upon it. 4 Any relationship in which the body enters is based not on love, but on idolatry. 5</string>
                    <string>Love wishes to be known, completely understood and shared. 6 It has no secrets; nothing that it</string>

                    <string>reality. 2 The Holy Spirit rests within it in the certainty it will endure forever. 3 Its firm foundation</string>
                    <string>is eternally upheld by truth, and love shines on it with the gentle smile and tender blessing it offers</string>
                    <string>to its own. 4 Here the unholy instant is exchanged in gladness for the holy one of safe return. 5</string>
                    <string>Here is the way to true relationships held gently open, through which you and your brother walk</string>
                    <string>together, leaving the body thankfully behind and resting in the Everlasting Arms. 6 Love's Arms are</string>
                    <string>open to receive you, and give you peace forever.</string>

                    <string>T-20.VI.11. The body is the ego's idol; the belief in sin made flesh and then projected outward. 2</string>
                    <string>This produces what seems to be a wall of flesh around the mind, keeping it prisoner in a tiny spot of</string>
                    <string>space and time, beholden unto death, and given but an instant in which to sigh and grieve and die in</string>
                    <string>honor of its master. 3 And this unholy instant seems to be life; an instant of despair, a tiny island of</string>
                    <string>dry sand, bereft of water and set uncertainly upon oblivion. 4 Here does the Son of God stop briefly</string>
                    <string>by, to offer his devotion to death's idols and then pass on. 5 And here he is more dead than living. 6</string>
                    <string>Yet it is also here he makes his choice again between idolatry and love. 7 Here it is given him to</string>
                    <string>choose to spend this instant paying tribute to the body, or let himself be given freedom from it. 8</string>
                    <string>Here he can accept the holy instant, offered him to replace the unholy one he chose before. 9 And</string>
                    <string>here can he learn relationships are his salvation, and not his doom.</string>

                    <string>instant is of greater value now to you than its unholy seeming counterpart, and you have learned you</string>
                    <string>really want but one. 3 This is no time for sadness. 4 Perhaps confusion, but hardly discouragement.</string>
                    <string>5 You have a real relationship, and it has meaning. 6 It is as like your real relationship with God as</string>
                    <string>equal things are like unto each other. 7 Idolatry is past and meaningless. 8 Perhaps you fear your</string>
                    <string>brother a little yet; perhaps a shadow of the fear of God remains with you. 9 Yet what is that to</string>
                    <string>those who have been given one true relationship beyond the body? 10 Can they be long held back</string>
                    <string>from looking on the face of Christ? 11 And can they long withhold the memory of their relationship</string>

                    <string>T-20.VII.1. We have said much about discrepancies of means and end, and how these must be</string>
                    <string>brought in line before your holy relationship can bring you only joy. 2 But we have also said the</string>
                    <string>means to meet the Holy Spirit's goal will come from the same Source as does His purpose. 3 Being</string>
                    <string>so simple and direct, this course has nothing in it that is not consistent. 4 The seeming</string>
                    <string>inconsistencies, or parts you find more difficult than others, are merely indications of areas where</string>
                    <string>means and end are still discrepant. 5 And this produces great discomfort. 6 This need not be. 7 This</string>
                    <string>course requires almost nothing of you. 8 It is impossible to imagine one that asks so little, or could</string>
                    <string>offer more.</string>

                    <string>T-20.VII.2. The period of discomfort that follows the sudden change in a relationship from sin to</string>
                    <string>holiness may now be almost over. 2 To the extent you still experience it, you are refusing to leave</string>
                    <string>the means to Him Who changed the purpose. 3 You recognize you want the goal. 4 Are you not also</string>
                    <string>willing to accept the means? 5 If you are not, let us admit that you are inconsistent. 6 A purpose is</string>
                    <string>attained by means, and if you want a purpose you must be willing to want the means as well. 7 How</string>
                    <string>can one be sincere and say, "I want this above all else, and yet I do not want to learn the means to</string>
                    <string>get it?"</string>

                    <string>T-20.VII.3. To obtain the goal the Holy Spirit indeed asks little. 2 He asks no more to give the</string>
                    <string>means as well. 3 The means are second to the goal. 4 And when you hesitate, it is because the</string>
                    <string>purpose frightens you, and not the means. 5 Remember this, for otherwise you will make the error</string>
                    <string>of believing the means are difficult. 6 Yet how can they be difficult if they are merely given you? 7</string>
                    <string>They guarantee the goal, and they are perfectly in line with it. 8 Before we look at them a little</string>
                    <string>closer, remember that if you think they are impossible, your wanting of the purpose has been</string>
                    <string>shaken. 9 For if a goal is possible to reach, the means to do so must be possible as well.</string>

                    <string>T-20.VII.4. It is impossible to see your brother as sinless and yet to look upon him as a body. 2 Is</string>
                    <string>this not perfectly consistent with the goal of holiness? 3 For holiness is merely the result of letting</string>
                    <string>the effects of sin be lifted, so what was always true is recognized. 4 To see a sinless body is</string>
                    <string>impossible, for holiness is positive and the body is merely neutral. 5 It is not sinful, but neither is it</string>
                    <string>sinless. 6 As nothing, which it is, the body cannot meaningfully be invested with attributes of Christ</string>
                    <string>or of the ego. 7 Either must be an error, for both would place the attributes where they cannot be. 8</string>
                    <string>And both must be undone for purposes of truth.</string>

                    <string>2 The unholy instant is the time of bodies. 3 But the purpose here is sin. 4 It cannot be attained but</string>
                    <string>in illusion, and so the illusion of a brother as a body is quite in keeping with the purpose of</string>
                    <string>unholiness. 5 Because of this consistency, the means remain unquestioned while the end is</string>
                    <string>cherished. 6 Seeing adapts to wish, for sight is always secondary to desire. 7 And if you see the</string>
                    <string>body, you have chosen judgment and not vision. 8 For vision, like relationships, has no order. 9 You</string>
                    <string>either see or not.</string>

                    <string>T-20.VII.6. Who sees a brother's body has laid a judgment on him, and sees him not. 2 He does not</string>
                    <string>really see him as sinful; he does not see him at all. 3 In the darkness of sin he is invisible. 4 He can</string>
                    <string>but be imagined in the darkness, and it is here that the illusions you hold about him are not held up</string>
                    <string>to his reality. 5 Here are illusions and reality kept separated. 6 Here are illusions never brought to</string>
                    <string>truth, and always hidden from it. 7 And here, in darkness, is your brother's reality imagined as a</string>
                    <string>body, in unholy relationships with other bodies, serving the cause of sin an instant before he dies.</string>

                    <string>T-20.VII.7. There is indeed a difference between this vain imagining and vision. 2 The difference</string>
                    <string>lies not in them, but in their purpose. 3 Both are but means, each one appropriate to the end for</string>
                    <string>which it is employed. 4 Neither can serve the purpose of the other, for each one is a choice of</string>
                    <string>purpose, employed on its behalf. 5 Either is meaningless without the end for which it was intended,</string>
                    <string>nor is it valued as a separate thing apart from the intention. 6 The means seem real because the goal</string>
                    <string>is valued. 7 And judgment has no value unless the goal is sin.</string>

                    <string>T-20.VII.8. The body cannot be looked upon except through judgment. 2 To see the body is the sign</string>
                    <string>that you lack vision, and have denied the means the Holy Spirit offers you to serve His purpose. 3</string>
                    <string>How can a holy relationship achieve its purpose through the means of sin? 4 Judgment you taught</string>
                    <string>yourself; vision is learned from Him Who would undo your teaching. 5 His vision cannot see the</string>
                    <string>body because it cannot look on sin. 6 And thus it leads you to reality. 7 Your holy brother, sight of</string>
                    <string>whom is your release, is no illusion. 8 Attempt to see him not in darkness, for your imaginings</string>
                    <string>about him will seem real there. 9 You closed your eyes to shut him out. 10 Such was your purpose,</string>
                    <string>and while this purpose seems to have a meaning, the means for its attainment will be evaluated as</string>
                    <string>worth the seeing, and so you will not see.</string>

                    <string>look upon is sinless. 7 No one who loves can judge, and what he sees is free of condemnation. 8</string>
                    <string>And what he sees he did not make, for it was given him to see, as was the vision that made his</string>

                    <string>that you did this. 5 Once you accept this simple fact and take unto yourself the power you gave</string>
                    <string>them, you are released from them. 6 One thing is sure; hallucinations serve a purpose, and when that</string>

                    <string>seeming independence of effect enables it to be regarded as standing by itself, and capable of</string>
                    <string>serving as a cause of the events and feelings its maker thinks it causes. 4 Earlier, we spoke of your</string>

                    <string>nothing. 3 He makes no bargains. 4 And if you seek to limit Him, you will hate Him because you are</string>

                    <string>mind could neither ask it nor receive it of itself. 4 And no more could the body. 5 The intention is in</string>
                    <string>the mind, which tries to use the body to carry out the means for sin in which the mind believes. 6</string>
                    <string>Thus is the joining of mind and body an inescapable belief of those who value sin. 7 And so is</string>

                    <string>This you would not be fearful to admit. 5 Fear in association with sin the ego deems quite</string>

                    <string>4 They are not equal. 5 For what you look for you are far more likely to discover than what you</string>
                    <string>would prefer to overlook. 6 The still, small Voice for God is not drowned out by all the ego's</string>
                    <string>raucous screams and senseless ravings to those who want to hear It. 7 Perception is a choice and not</string>
                    <string>a fact. 8 But on this choice depends far more than you may realize as yet. 9 For on the voice you</string>
                    <string>choose to hear, and on the sights you choose to see, depends entirely your whole belief in what you</string>
                    <string>are. 10 Perception is a witness but to this, and never to reality. 11 Yet it can show you the</string>

                    <string>you deny it to yourself and to your brother. 8 And if he shares this same belief you both will think</string>
                    <string>that you are damned. 9 This you could spare him and yourself. 10 For reason would not make way</string>

                    <string>his Father forever, without a hope of safe return. 3 You teach him this, and you will learn of him</string>

                    <string>reassure you, and seeks not to frighten you. 4 The power to heal the Son of God is given you</string>
                    <string>because he must be one with you. 5 You are responsible for how he sees himself. 6 And reason tells</string>
                    <string>you it is given you to change his whole mind, which is one with you, in just an instant. 7 And any</string>
                    <string>instant serves to bring complete correction of his errors and make him whole. 8 The instant that you</string>
                    <string>choose to let yourself be healed, in that same instant is his whole salvation seen as complete with</string>
                    <string>yours. 9 Reason is given you to understand that this is so. 10 For reason, kind as is the purpose for</string>
                    <string>which it is the means, leads steadily away from madness toward the goal of truth. 11 And here you</string>

                    <string>your helplessness for power, and lose this same desire as a little glint of sin attracts you. 8 And you</string>
                    <string>can want to see a sinless world, and let an "enemy" tempt you to use the body's eyes and change</string>

                    <string>And therefore those who look on sin are seeing the denial of the real world. 4 Yet the last question</string>
                    <string>adds the wish for constancy in your desire to see the real world, so the desire becomes the only one</string>
                    <string>you have. 5 By answering the final question "yes," you add sincerity to the decisions you have</string>
                    <string>already made to all the rest. 6 For only then have you renounced the option to change your mind</string>

                    <string>both "yes" and "no." 4 For you have answered "yes" without perceiving that "yes" must mean "not</string>
                    <string>no." 5 No one decides against his happiness, but he may do so if he does not see he does it. 6 And if</string>

                    <string>everything and sees it is the same. 6 It sees not the ephemeral, for it desires everything be like itself,</string>

                    <string>reached out beyond the body, to let you and your brother be joined. 8 And now the sameness that</string>
                    <string>you saw extends and finally removes all sense of differences, so that the sameness that lies beneath</string>
                    <string>them all becomes apparent. 9 Here is the golden circle where you recognize the Son of God. 10 For</string>

                    <string>for reason and the ego are contradictory. 2 Nor is it possible for them to coexist in your awareness. 3</string>
                    <string>For reason's goal is to make plain, and therefore obvious. 4 You can see reason. 5 This is not a play</string>
                    <string>on words, for here is the beginning of a vision that has meaning. 6 Vision is sense, quite literally. 7</string>
                    <string>If it is not the body's sight, it must be understood. 8 For it is plain, and what is obvious is not</string>
                    <string>ambiguous. 9 It can be understood. 10 And here do reason and the ego separate, to go their separate</string>

                    <string>this belief, and reason will be unable to see your errors and make way for their correction. 3 For</string>
                    <string>reason sees through errors, telling you what you thought was real is not. 4 Reason can see the</string>
                    <string>difference between sin and mistakes, because it wants correction. 5 Therefore, it tells you what you</string>
                    <string>thought was uncorrectable can be corrected, and thus it must have been an error. 6 The ego's</string>
                    <string>opposition to correction leads to its fixed belief in sin and disregard of errors. 7 It looks on nothing</string>
                    <string>that can be corrected. 8 Thus does the ego damn, and reason save.</string>

                    <string>mind in which salvation can be given you. 2 Sin is a block, set like a heavy gate, locked and without</string>
                    <string>a key, across the road to peace. 3 No one who looks on it without the help of reason would try to</string>
                    <string>pass it. 4 The body's eyes behold it as solid granite, so thick it would be madness to attempt to pass</string>
                    <string>it. 5 Yet reason sees through it easily, because it is an error. 6 The form it takes cannot conceal its</string>

                    <string>see if it is there or not. 3 Everything the body's eyes can see is a mistake, an error in perception, a</string>
                    <string>distorted fragment of the whole without the meaning that the whole would give. 4 And yet mistakes,</string>
                    <string>regardless of their form, can be corrected. 5 Sin is but error in a special form the ego venerates. 6 It</string>
                    <string>would preserve all errors and make them sins. 7 For here is its own stability, its heavy anchor in the</string>
                    <string>shifting world it made; the rock on which its church is built, and where its worshippers are bound to</string>

                    <string>They cannot see beyond what they were made to see. 5 And they were made to look on error and</string>
                    <string>not see past it. 6 Theirs is indeed a strange perception, for they can see only illusions, unable to look</string>
                    <string>beyond the granite block of sin, and stopping at the outside form of nothing. 7 To this distorted</string>
                    <string>form of vision the outside of everything, the wall that stands between you and the truth, is wholly</string>
                    <string>true. 8 Yet how can sight that stops at nothingness, as if it were a solid wall, see truly? 9 It is held</string>

                    <string>for it is but a veil that stands between you. 4 Either you or your brother alone will see it as a solid</string>

                    <string>merely is needs no defense, and offers none. 8 Only illusions need defense because of weakness. 9</string>
                    <string>And how can it be difficult to walk the way of truth when only weakness interferes? 10 You are the</string>
                    <string>strong one in this seeming conflict. 11 And you need no defense. 12 Everything that needs defense</string>

                    <string>Spirit offers must be defended against and sacrificed. 8 For sin is carved into a block out of your</string>

                    <string>impossible to keep love out. 8 God rests with you in quiet, undefended and wholly undefending, for</string>
                    <string>in this quiet state alone is strength and power. 9 Here can no weakness enter, for here is no attack</string>
                    <string>and therefore no illusions. 10 Love rests in certainty. 11 Only uncertainty can be defensive. 12 And</string>

                    <string>yours. 2 But you will not remember this while you believe attack of any kind means anything. 3 It is</string>
                    <string>unjustified in any form, because it has no meaning. 4 The only way it could be justified is if you and</string>
                    <string>your brother were separate from the other, and all were separate from your Creator. 5 For only then</string>
                    <string>would it be possible to attack a part of the creation without the whole, the Son without the Father;</string>
                    <string>and to attack another without yourself, or hurt yourself without the other feeling pain. 6 And this</string>
                    <string>belief you want. 7 Yet wherein lies its value, except in the desire to attack in safety? 8 Attack is</string>
                    <string>neither safe nor dangerous. 9 It is impossible. 10 And this is so because the universe is one. 11 You</string>
                    <string>would not choose attack on its reality if it were not essential to attack to see it separated from its</string>
                    <string>maker. 12 And thus it seems as if love could attack and become fearful.</string>

                    <string>your brother are not different, you cannot attack. 5 Either position is a logical conclusion. 6 Either</string>
                    <string>could be maintained, but never both. 7 The only question to be answered in order to decide which</string>
                    <string>must be true is whether you and your brother are different. 8 From the position of what you</string>
                    <string>understand you seem to be, and therefore can attack. 9 Of the alternatives, this seems more natural</string>

                    <string>this one maintains that each is separate and has a different set of thoughts that set him off from</string>

                    <string>valuable and therefore true. 4 Each one establishes this for himself, and makes it true by his attack</string>
                    <string>on what another values. 5 And this is justified because the values differ, and those who hold them</string>

                    <string>overcome than others. 3 If it were realized that they are all the same and equally untrue, it would be</string>
                    <string>easy, then, to understand that miracles apply to all of them. 4 Errors of any kind can be corrected</string>
                    <string>because they are untrue. 5 When brought to truth instead of to each other, they merely disappear. 6</string>

                    <string>demand that errors call for punishment and not correction. 3 For the destruction of the one who</string>
                    <string>makes the error places him beyond correction and beyond forgiveness. 4 What he has done is thus</string>
                    <string>interpreted as an irrevocable sentence upon himself, which God Himself is powerless to overcome. 5</string>
                    <string>Sin cannot be remitted, being the belief the Son of God can make mistakes for which his own</string>

                    <string>that He be asked about the truth of what has been established for His belief. 4 His Son can tell Him</string>
                    <string>this, and He has but the choice whether to take his word for it or be mistaken. 5 This leads directly</string>
                    <string>to the third preposterous belief that seems to make chaos eternal. 6 For if God cannot be mistaken,</string>

                    <string>brother's body, hidden there in malice and in hatred for the one to whom the gift belongs. 9 He</string>
                    <string>would deprive you of the secret ingredient that would give meaning to your life. 10 The substitute</string>
                    <string>for love, born of your enmity to your brother, must be salvation. 11 It has no substitute, and there is</string>
                    <string>only one. 12 And all your relationships have but the purpose of seizing it and making it your own.</string>

                    <string>value specialness is to esteem an alien will to which illusions of yourself are dearer than the truth.</string>

                    <string>danger of destruction it must kill, and you are drawn to it to kill it first. 6 And such is guilt's</string>

                    <string>quite obvious. 5 The purpose of attack is in the mind, and its effects are felt but where it is. 6 Nor is</string>
                    <string>the mind limited; so must it be that harmful purpose hurts the mind as one. 7 Nothing could make</string>
                    <string>less sense to specialness. 8 Nothing could make more sense to miracles. 9 For miracles are merely</string>
                    <string>change of purpose from hurt to healing. 10 This shift in purpose does "endanger" specialness, but</string>

                    <string>and blessing so complete that not one trace of conflict still remains to haunt you in the darkness of</string>
                    <string>the night. 2 He is your savior from the dreams of fear. 3 He is the healing of your sense of sacrifice</string>
                    <string>and fear that what you have will scatter with the wind and turn to dust. 4 In him is your assurance</string>
                    <string>God is here, and with you now. 5 While he is what he is, you can be sure that God is knowable and</string>
                    <string>will be known to you. 6 For He could never leave His Own creation. 7 And the sign that this is so</string>

                    <string>holiness. 8 See in him God's creation. 9 For in him his Father waits for your acknowledgment that</string>

                    <string>because His Will is One. 4 Nothing alive that is not part of Him, and nothing is but is alive in Him.</string>
                    <string>5 Your brother's holiness shows you that God is One with him and you; that what he has is yours</string>

                    <string>4 It is His Will you share His Love for you, and look upon yourself as lovingly as He conceived of</string>
                    <string>you before the world began, and as He knows you still. 5 God changes not His Mind about His Son</string>
                    <string>with passing circumstance which has no meaning in eternity where He abides, and you with Him. 6</string>
                    <string>Your brother is as He created him. 11 7 And it is this that saves you from a world that He created</string>

                    <string>and every circumstance, in all temptation to perceive what is not there, and all belief God's Son can</string>

                    <string>this world. 2 See in his freedom yours, for such it is. 3 Let not his specialness obscure the truth in</string>

                    <string>keeps you both in hell. 5 Yet will his perfect sinlessness release you both, for holiness is quite</string>
                    <string>impartial, with one judgment made for all it looks upon. 6 And that is made, not of itself, but</string>
                    <string>through the Voice that speaks for God in everything that lives and shares His Being.</string>

                    <string>And let the fear of God no longer hold the vision you were meant to see from you. 7 Your brother's</string>
                    <string>body shows not Christ to you. 8 He is set forth within his holiness.</string>

                    <string>of Christ in him. 4 And where is your salvation, if he is but a body? 5 Where is your peace but in</string>
                    <string>his holiness? 6 And where is God Himself but in that part of Him He set forever in your brother's</string>
                    <string>holiness, that you might see the truth about yourself, set forth at last in terms you recognized and</string>

                    <string>not a part of him who stands beside you. 6 He is the mirror of yourself, wherein you see the</string>
                    <string>judgment you have laid on both of you. 7 The Christ in you beholds his holiness. 8 Your specialness</string>

                    <string>Futility of function not fulfilled will haunt you while your brother lies asleep, till what has been</string>

                    <string>truth as God established it no sacrifice is asked, no strain called forth, and all the power of Heaven</string>
                    <string>and the might of truth itself is given to provide the means, and guarantee the goal's accomplishment.</string>

                    <string>how they look, nor where they go, nor even what they do. 5 They have a different purpose. 6 It is</string>

                    <string>a sin or a mistake, forgivable or not? 5 Does he need help or condemnation? 6 Is it your purpose</string>

                    <string>and they rejoice that this is so, seeing their safety in this happy fact. 3 Their joy is in the innocence</string>
                    <string>they see. 4 And thus they seek for it, because it is their purpose to behold it and rejoice. 5 Everyone</string>
                    <string>seeks for what will bring him joy as he defines it. 6 It is not the aim, as such, that varies. 7 Yet it is</string>
                    <string>the way in which the aim is seen that makes the choice of means inevitable, and beyond the hope of</string>
                    <string>change unless the aim is changed. 8 And then the means are chosen once again, as what will bring</string>

                    <string>be there for you to see. 3 Nothing is harmful or beneficent apart from what you wish. 4 It is your</string>
                    <string>wish that makes it what it is in its effects on you. 5 Because you chose it as a means to gain these</string>
                    <string>same effects, believing them to be the bringers of rejoicing and of joy. 6 Even in Heaven does this</string>

                    <string>no reason to perceive the Son of God as other than he is. 2 The need for guilt is gone because it has</string>
                    <string>no purpose, and is meaningless without the goal of sin. 3 Attack and sin are bound as one illusion,</string>
                    <string>each the cause and aim and justifier of the other. 4 Each is meaningless alone, but seems to draw a</string>
                    <string>meaning from the other. 5 Each depends upon the other for whatever sense it seems to have. 6 And</string>
                    <string>no one could believe in one unless the other were the truth, for each attests the other must be true.</string>

                    <string>made your Self your "enemy." 5 And now you must believe you are not you, but something alien to</string>
                    <string>yourself and "something else," a "something" to be feared instead of loved. 6 Who would attack</string>
                    <string>whatever he perceives as wholly innocent? 7 And who, because he wishes to attack, can fail to</string>
                    <string>think he must be guilty to maintain the wish, while wanting innocence? 8 For who could see the</string>
                    <string>Son of God as innocent and wish him dead? 9 Christ stands before you, each time you look upon</string>
                    <string>your brother. 10 He has not gone because your eyes are closed. 11 But what is there to see by</string>

                    <string>Forgiven by you, your savior offers you salvation. 6 Condemned by you, he offers death to you. 7 In</string>

                    <string>will be your joy, when he is free to offer you the gift of sight God gave to him for you! 6 He has no</string>

                    <string>is the only function meaningful in time. 4 It is the means the Holy Spirit uses to translate specialness</string>

                    <string>imposed on you, its values are not yours. 3 And nothing that you think you see in it is really there at</string>
                    <string>all. 4 This is seen and understood as each one takes his part in its undoing, as he did in making it. 5</string>
                    <string>He has the means for either, as he always did. 6 The specialness he chose to hurt himself did God</string>
                    <string>appoint to be the means for his salvation, from the very instant that the choice was made. 7 His</string>
                    <string>special sin was made his special grace. 8 His special hate became his special love.</string>

                    <string>blessing, then it cannot be a sin. 2 Sin is the only thing in all the world that cannot change. 3 It is</string>
                    <string>immutable. 4 And on its changelessness the world depends. 5 The magic of the world can seem to</string>
                    <string>hide the pain of sin from sinners, and deceive with glitter and with guile. 6 Yet each one knows the</string>
                    <string>cost of sin is death. 7 And so it is. 8 For sin is a request for death, a wish to make this world's</string>
                    <string>foundation sure as love, dependable as Heaven, and as strong as God Himself. 9 The world is safe</string>
                    <string>from love to everyone who thinks sin possible. 10 Nor will it change. 11 Yet is it possible what God</string>
                    <string>created not should share the attributes of His creation, when it opposes it in every way?</string>

                    <string>can the basis of a world He did not make be firm and sure as Heaven. 3 How could it be that hell</string>
                    <string>and Heaven are the same? 4 And is it possible that what He did not will cannot be changed? 5 What</string>
                    <string>is immutable besides His Will? 6 And what can share its attributes except itself? 7 What wish can</string>
                    <string>rise against His Will, and be immutable? 8 If you could realize nothing is changeless but the Will of</string>
                    <string>God, this course would not be difficult for you. 9 For it is this that you do not believe. 10 Yet there</string>

                    <string>T-25.VII.3. Let us go back to what we said before, and think of it more carefully. 2 It must be so</string>
                    <string>that either God is mad, or is this world a place of madness. 3 Not one Thought of His makes any</string>
                    <string>sense at all within this world. 4 And nothing that the world believes as true has any meaning in His</string>
                    <string>Mind at all. 5 What makes no sense and has no meaning is insanity. 6 And what is madness cannot</string>
                    <string>be the truth. 7 If one belief so deeply valued here were true, then every Thought God ever had is an</string>
                    <string>illusion. 8 And if but one Thought of His is true, then all beliefs the world gives any meaning to are</string>
                    <string>false, and make no sense at all. 9 This is the choice you make. 10 Do not attempt to see it</string>
                    <string>differently, nor twist it into something it is not. 11 For only this decision can you make. 12 The rest</string>
                    <string>is up to God, and not to you.</string>

                    <string>T-25.VII.4. To justify one value that the world upholds is to deny your Father's sanity and yours. 2</string>
                    <string>For God and His beloved Son do not think differently. 3 And it is the agreement of their thought that</string>
                    <string>makes the Son a co-creator with the Mind Whose Thought created him. 4 So if he chooses to</string>
                    <string>believe one thought opposed to truth, he has decided he is not his Father's Son because the Son is</string>
                    <string>mad, and sanity must lie apart from both the Father and the Son. 5 This you believe. 6 Think not</string>
                    <string>that this belief depends upon the form it takes. 7 Who thinks the world is sane in any way, is</string>
                    <string>justified in anything it thinks, or is maintained by any form of reason, believes this to be true. 8 Sin</string>
                    <string>is not real because the Father and the Son are not insane. 9 This world is meaningless because it</string>
                    <string>rests on sin. 10 Who could create the changeless if it does not rest on truth?</string>

                    <string>perceived. 2 And one in which nothing is contradicted that would lead the Son of God to sanity and</string>
                    <string>joy. 3 Nothing attests to death and cruelty; to separation and to differences. 4 For here is everything</string>

                    <string>love is sin, and either one perceives the other as insane and meaningless. 4 Love is the basis for a</string>
                    <string>world perceived as wholly mad to sinners, who believe theirs is the way to sanity. 5 But sin is</string>
                    <string>equally insane within the sight of love, whose gentle eyes would look beyond the madness and rest</string>
                    <string>peacefully on truth. 6 Each sees a world immutable, as each defines the changeless and eternal truth</string>
                    <string>of what you are. 7 And each reflects a view of what the Father and the Son must be, to make that</string>

                    <string>appears most sensible and meaningful to you. 2 The content is the same. 3 The form is suited to</string>
                    <string>your special needs, and to the special time and place in which you think you find yourself, and</string>
                    <string>where you can be free of place and time, and all that you believe must limit you. 4 The Son of God</string>
                    <string>cannot be bound by time nor place nor anything God did not will. 5 Yet if His Will is seen as</string>
                    <string>madness, then the form of sanity which makes it most acceptable to those who are insane requires</string>
                    <string>special choice. 6 Nor can this choice be made by the insane, whose problem is their choices are not</string>

                    <string>but points to an alternative, another way of looking at what he has seen before, and recognizes as</string>

                    <string>to be perceived as possible, and more and more desired, as it proves to him that it is an alternative</string>
                    <string>he really wants. 3 From this position does his sinfulness, and all the sin he sees within the world,</string>
                    <string>offer him less and less. 4 Until he comes to understand it cost him his sanity, and stands between</string>
                    <string>him and whatever hope he has of being sane. 5 Nor is he left without escape from madness, for he</string>
                    <string>has a special part in everyone's escape. 6 He can no more be left outside, without a special function</string>
                    <string>in the hope of peace, than could the Father overlook His Son, and pass him by in careless</string>

                    <string>You who believe that God is mad, look carefully at this, and understand that it must be either God</string>

                    <string>preserved and kept. 6 It is a payment offered for the cost of sin, but not the total cost. 7 The rest is</string>

                    <string>3 It is the symbol of the central theme that somebody must lose. 4 Its focus on the body is apparent,</string>
                    <string>for it is always an attempt to limit loss. 5 The body is itself a sacrifice; a giving up of power in the</string>
                    <string>name of saving just a little for yourself. 6 To see a brother in another body, separate from yours, is</string>
                    <string>the expression of a wish to see a little part of him and sacrifice the rest. 7 Look at the world, and</string>
                    <string>you will see nothing attached to anything beyond itself. 8 All seeming entities can come a little</string>

                    <string>what is inside can never reach without, and what is out can never reach and join with what is locked</string>
                    <string>away within the wall. 4 Each part must sacrifice the other part, to keep itself complete. 5 For if they</string>
                    <string>joined each one would lose its own identity, and by their separation are their selves maintained.</string>

                    <string>3 In this perception of yourself the body's loss would be a sacrifice indeed. 4 For sight of bodies</string>
                    <string>becomes the sign that sacrifice is limited, and something still remains for you alone. 5 And for this</string>
                    <string>little to belong to you are limits placed on everything outside, just as they are on everything you</string>
                    <string>think is yours. 6 For giving and receiving are the same. 7 And to accept the limits of a body is to</string>
                    <string>impose these limits on each brother whom you see. 8 For you must see him as you see yourself.</string>

                    <string>body, apart from you and separate in his cell, you are demanding sacrifice of him and you. 3 What</string>
                    <string>greater sacrifice could be demanded than that God's Son perceive himself without his Father? 4 And</string>
                    <string>his Father be without His Son? 5 Yet every sacrifice demands that they be separate and without the</string>
                    <string>other. 6 The memory of God must be denied if any sacrifice is asked of anyone. 7 What witness to</string>
                    <string>the Wholeness of God's Son is seen within a world of separate bodies, however much he witnesses</string>
                    <string>to truth? 8 He is invisible in such a world. 9 Nor can his song of union and of love be heard at all.</string>
                    <string>10 Yet is it given him to make the world recede before his song, and sight of him replace the body's</string>

                    <string>you think are great and cannot be resolved. 4 For there are those you want to suffer loss, and no one</string>
                    <string>whom you wish to be preserved from sacrifice entirely. 5 Consider once again your special function.</string>
                    <string>6 One is given you to see in him his perfect sinlessness. 7 And you will ask no sacrifice of him</string>
                    <string>because you could not will he suffer loss. 8 The miracle of justice you call forth will rest on you as</string>
                    <string>surely as on him. 9 Nor will the Holy Spirit be content until it is received by everyone. 10 For what</string>
                    <string>you give to Him is everyone's, and by your giving it can He ensure that everyone receives it equally.</string>

                    <string>little in His sight, and worth no more than just a tiny sigh before they disappear, to be forever</string>
                    <string>undone and unremembered. 5 What seemed once to be a special problem, a mistake without a</string>
                    <string>remedy, or an affliction without a cure, has been transformed into a universal blessing. 6 Sacrifice is</string>
                    <string>gone. 7 And in its place the Love of God can be remembered, and will shine away all memory of</string>

                    <string>as He created it. 3 Nothing He loves but must be sinless and beyond attack. 4 Your special function</string>
                    <string>opens wide the door beyond which is the memory of His Love kept perfectly intact and undefiled. 5</string>
                    <string>And all you need to do is but to wish that Heaven be given you instead of hell, and every bolt and</string>

                    <string>could there be complexity in Him? 6 What is there to decide? 7 For it is conflict that makes choice</string>

                    <string>perception: "It has no meaning, and does not exist." 4 This is not your decision. 5 It is but a simple</string>
                    <string>statement of a simple fact. 6 But in this world there are no simple facts, because what is the same</string>
                    <string>and what is different remain unclear. 7 The one essential thing to make a choice at all is this</string>
                    <string>distinction. 8 And herein lies the difference between the worlds. 9 In this one, choice is made</string>

                    <string>into a simple world, where justice can be reflected from beyond the gate behind which total lack of</string>
                    <string>limits lies. 3 Nothing in boundless love could need forgiveness. 4 And what is charity within the</string>
                    <string>world gives way to simple justice past the gate that opens into Heaven. 5 No one forgives unless he</string>
                    <string>has believed in sin, and still believes that he has much to be forgiven. 6 Forgiveness thus becomes</string>
                    <string>the means by which he learns he has done nothing to forgive. 7 Forgiveness always rests upon the</string>
                    <string>one who offers it, until he sees himself as needing it no more. 8 And thus is he returned to his real</string>

                    <string>stands between to keep them separate and apart. 5 The sinless must perceive that they are one, for</string>
                    <string>nothing stands between to push the other off. 6 And in the space that sin left vacant do they join as</string>

                    <string>the Son of God ask not too much, but far too little. 8 He would sacrifice his own identity with</string>

                    <string>failure lies in that you still feel guilty, though without understanding why. 7 Effects are seen as</string>

                    <string>source is to invite illusions to be true, without success. 6 For never will success be possible in trying</string>

                    <string>guilt. 5 For otherwise he still demands that he must make some sacrifice, and thus denies that</string>
                    <string>everything is his, unlimited by loss of any kind. 6 A tiny sacrifice is just the same in its effects as is</string>
                    <string>the whole idea of sacrifice. 7 If loss in any form is possible, then is God's Son made incomplete and</string>

                    <string>No purpose has been given it as yet, and what will happen has as yet no cause. 3 Who can predict</string>
                    <string>effects without a cause? 4 And who could fear effects unless he thought they had been caused, and</string>
                    <string>judged disastrous now? 5 Belief in sin arouses fear, and like its cause, is looking forward, looking</string>
                    <string>back, but overlooking what is here and now. 6 Yet only here and now its cause must be, if its</string>
                    <string>effects already have been judged as fearful. 7 And in overlooking this, is it protected and kept</string>
                    <string>separate from healing. 8 For a miracle is now. 9 It stands already here, in present grace, within the</string>
                    <string>only interval of time that sin and fear have overlooked, but which is all there is to time.</string>

                    <string>working out can seem to take forever. 3 The change of purpose the Holy Spirit brought to your</string>
                    <string>relationship has in it all effects that you will see. 4 They can be looked at now. 5 Why wait till they</string>
                    <string>unfold in time and fear they may not come, although already there? 6 You have been told that</string>
                    <string>everything brings good that comes from God. 7 And yet it seems as if this is not so. 8 Good in</string>
                    <string>disaster's form is difficult to credit in advance. 9 Nor is there really sense in this idea.</string>

                    <string>And you seek to be content with sighing, and with "reasoning" you do not understand it now, but</string>
                    <string>will some day. 7 And then its meaning will be clear. 8 This is not reason, for it is unjust, and clearly</string>
                    <string>hints at punishment until the time of liberation is at hand. 9 Given a change of purpose for the good,</string>
                    <string>there is no reason for an interval in which disaster strikes, to be perceived as "good" some day but</string>
                    <string>now in form of pain. 10 This is a sacrifice of now, which could not be the cost the Holy Spirit asks</string>

                    <string>3 For you have cause for freedom now. 4 What profits freedom in a prisoner's form? 5 Why should</string>
                    <string>deliverance be disguised as death? 6 Delay is senseless, and the "reasoning" that would maintain</string>
                    <string>effects of present cause must be delayed until a future time, is merely a denial of the fact that</string>
                    <string>consequence and cause must come as one. 7 Look not to time, but to the little space between you</string>
                    <string>still, to be delivered from. 8 And do not let it be disguised as time, and so preserved because its</string>
                    <string>form is changed and what it is cannot be recognized. 9 The Holy Spirit's purpose now is yours. 10</string>

                    <string>forgiven all your sins, and left without a single one you cherish still? 2 Forget not that a shadow</string>

                    <string>would you trade Them for an ancient hate? 4 The ground whereon you stand is holy ground because</string>

                    <string>temple in a world of light. 3 Because of Them. 4 It is Their Presence which has lifted holiness again</string>
                    <string>to take its ancient place upon an ancient throne. 5 Because of Them have miracles sprung up as</string>
                    <string>grass and flowers on the barren ground that hate had scorched and rendered desolate. 6 What hate</string>
                    <string>has wrought have They undone. 7 And now you stand on ground so holy Heaven leans to join with</string>
                    <string>it, and make it like itself. 8 The shadow of an ancient hate has gone, and all the blight and withering</string>

                    <string>are healed within His sight. 5 An ancient miracle has come to bless and to replace an ancient enmity</string>

                    <string>have a differential view of when attack is justified, and when you think it is unfair and not to be</string>
                    <string>allowed. 3 When you perceive it as unfair, you think that a response of anger now is just. 4 And thus</string>
                    <string>you see what is the same as different. 5 Confusion is not limited. 6 If it occurs at all it will be total.</string>
                    <string>7 And its presence, in whatever form, will hide Their Presence. 8 They are known with clarity or not</string>
                    <string>at all. 9 Confused perception will block knowledge. 10 It is not a question of the size of the</string>
                    <string>confusion, or how much it interferes. 11 Its simple presence shuts the door to Theirs, and keeps</string>

                    <string>that there must be some forms in which you think it fair. 3 For otherwise, how could some be</string>
                    <string>evaluated as unfair? 4 Some, then, are given meaning and perceived as sensible. 5 And only some</string>
                    <string>are seen as meaningless. 6 And this denies the fact that all are senseless, equally without a cause or</string>
                    <string>consequence, and cannot have effects of any kind. 7 Their Presence is obscured by any veil that</string>
                    <string>stands between Their shining innocence, and your awareness that it is your own and equally belongs</string>
                    <string>to every living thing along with you. 8 God limits not. 9 And what is limited cannot be Heaven. 10</string>

                    <string>everything perceived to be unfair and not your just deserts. 5 Yet it is you who ask this of yourself,</string>
                    <string>in deep injustice to the Son of God. 6 You have no enemy except yourself, and you are enemy</string>
                    <string>indeed to him because you do not know him as yourself. 7 What could be more unjust than that he</string>
                    <string>be deprived of what he is, denied the right to be himself, and asked to sacrifice his Father's Love</string>

                    <string>find an innocence that is not Theirs but yours alone, and at the cost of someone else's guilt. 3 Can</string>
                    <string>innocence be purchased by the giving of your guilt to someone else? 4 And is it innocence that your</string>
                    <string>attack on him attempts to get? 5 Is it not retribution for your own attack upon the Son of God you</string>
                    <string>seek? 6 Is it not safer to believe that you are innocent of this, and victimized despite your</string>
                    <string>innocence? 7 Whatever way the game of guilt is played, there must be loss. 8 Someone must lose</string>

                    <string>And this you seek to add unto the purpose given it. 4 The Holy Spirit's purpose is to let the Presence</string>

                    <string>purposeless except for this. 6 To add or take away from this one goal is but to take away all purpose</string>
                    <string>from the world and from yourself. 7 And each unfairness that the world appears to lay upon you,</string>
                    <string>you have laid on it by rendering it purposeless, without the function that the Holy Spirit sees. 8 And</string>

                    <string>light, abandoned to the dark, unfairly left without a purpose in a futile world. 4 The world is fair</string>
                    <string>because the Holy Spirit has brought injustice to the light within, and there has all unfairness been</string>

                    <string>3 Walk you the gentle way, and you will fear no evil and no shadows in the night. 4 But place no</string>
                    <string>terror symbols on your path, or you will weave a crown of thorns from which your brother and</string>
                    <string>yourself will not escape. 5 You cannot crucify yourself alone. 6 And if you are unfairly treated, he</string>
                    <string>must suffer the unfairness that you see. 7 You cannot sacrifice yourself alone. 8 For sacrifice is</string>
                    <string>total. 9 If it could occur at all it would entail the whole of God's creation, and the Father with the</string>

                    <string>vengeance that you suffer now belongs to him, and when it rests on him are you set free. 6 Wish not</string>

                    <string>Death seems an easy price, if they can say, "Behold me, brother, at your hand I die." 7 For sickness</string>
                    <string>is the witness to his guilt, and death would prove his errors must be sins. 8 Sickness is but a "little"</string>

                    <string>5 Show this unto your brother, who will see that every scar is healed, and every tear is wiped away</string>
                    <string>in laughter and in love. 6 And he will look on his forgiveness there, and with healed eyes will look</string>
                    <string>beyond it to the innocence that he beholds in you. 7 Here is the proof that he has never sinned; that</string>
                    <string>nothing which his madness bid him do was ever done, or ever had effects of any kind. 8 That no</string>
                    <string>reproach he laid upon his heart was ever justified, and no attack can ever touch him with the</string>

                    <string>this world. 4 Its only purpose is to prove guilt real. 5 No worldly thought or act or feeling has a</string>
                    <string>motivation other than this one. 6 These are the witnesses that are called forth to be believed, and</string>
                    <string>lend conviction to the system they speak for and represent. 7 And each has many voices, speaking to</string>

                    <string>Adornment of the body seeks to show how lovely are the witnesses for guilt. 10 Concerns about the</string>

                    <string>of life must come, whatever way that life be spent. 8 And so take pleasure in the quickly passing</string>

                    <string>innocence and sin will end alike within the termination of the grave. 2 If this were true, there would</string>

                    <string>Yet in this picture is the body not perceived as neutral and without a goal inherent in itself. 4 For it</string>
                    <string>becomes the symbol of reproach, the sign of guilt whose consequences still are there to see, so that</string>

                    <string>nothing yet, its purpose being open, and the mind made free again to choose what it is for. 10 Now</string>
                    <string>is it not condemned, but waiting for a purpose to be given, that it may fulfill the function that it will</string>

                    <string>breathing in the fetid scent of death. 4 Let it have healing as its purpose. 5 Then will it send forth</string>
                    <string>the message it received, and by its health and loveliness proclaim the truth and value that it</string>
                    <string>represents. 6 Let it receive the power to represent an endless life, forever unattacked. 7 And to your</string>

                    <string>an act of charity, but not his due. 9 He may be pitied for his guilt, but not exonerated. 10 And if you</string>

                    <string>6 Forgiveness is not pity, which but seeks to pardon what it thinks to be the truth. 7 Good cannot be</string>

                    <string>from his own. 9 Forgiveness cannot be for one and not the other. 10 Who forgives is healed. 11 And</string>
                    <string>in his healing lies the proof that he has truly pardoned, and retains no trace of condemnation that he</string>

                    <string>show your mind is healed, and has forgiven what he did not do. 3 And so is he convinced his</string>
                    <string>innocence was never lost, and healed along with you. 4 Thus does the miracle undo all things the</string>
                    <string>world attests can never be undone. 5 And hopelessness and death must disappear before the ancient</string>
                    <string>clarion call of life. 6 This call has power far beyond the weak and miserable cry of death and guilt.</string>
                    <string>7 The ancient calling of the Father to His Son, and of the Son unto His Own, will yet be the last</string>
                    <string>trumpet that the world will ever hear. 8 Brother, there is no death. 9 And this you learn when you but</string>
                    <string>wish to show your brother that you had no hurt of him. 10 He thinks your blood is on his hands, and</string>
                    <string>so he stands condemned. 11 Yet it is given you to show him, by your healing, that his guilt is but the</string>
                    <string>fabric of a senseless dream.</string>

                    <string>your brother and yourself. 3 Your healing saves him pain as well as you, and you are healed because</string>
                    <string>you wished him well. 4 This is the law the miracle obeys; that healing sees no specialness at all. 5 It</string>
                    <string>does not come from pity but from love. 6 And love would prove all suffering is but a vain</string>
                    <string>imagining, a foolish wish with no effects. 7 Your health is a result of your desire to see your brother</string>
                    <string>with no blood upon his hands, nor guilt upon his heart made heavy with the proof of sin. 8 And</string>
                    <string>what you wish is given you to see.</string>

                    <string>interpret differently. 3 The world perceives it as a statement of the "fact" that your salvation</string>
                    <string>sacrifices his. 4 The Holy Spirit knows your healing is the witness unto his, and cannot be apart</string>
                    <string>from his at all. 5 As long as he consents to suffer, you will be unhealed. 6 Yet you can show him</string>
                    <string>that his suffering is purposeless and wholly without cause. 7 Show him your healing, and he will</string>
                    <string>consent no more to suffer. 8 For his innocence has been established in your sight and his. 9 And</string>
                    <string>laughter will replace your sighs, because God's Son remembered that he is God's Son.</string>

                    <string>to represent their own serenity. 3 Their helplessness and weakness represent the grounds on which</string>
                    <string>they justify his pain. 4 The constant sting of guilt he suffers serves to prove that he is slave, but they</string>
                    <string>are free. 5 The constant pain they suffer demonstrates that they are free because they hold him</string>
                    <string>bound. 6 And sickness is desired to prevent a shift of balance in the sacrifice. 7 How could the Holy</string>
                    <string>Spirit be deterred an instant, even less, to reason with an argument for sickness such as this? 8 And</string>
                    <string>need your healing be delayed because you pause to listen to insanity?</string>

                    <string>3 If you assume correction's role, you lose the function of forgiveness. 4 No one can forgive until he</string>
                    <string>learns correction is but to forgive, and never to accuse. 5 Alone, you cannot see they are the same,</string>
                    <string>and therefore is correction not of you. 6 Identity and function are the same, and by your function do</string>
                    <string>you know yourself. 7 And thus, if you confuse your function with the function of Another, you must</string>
                    <string>be confused about yourself and who you are. 8 What is the separation but a wish to take God's</string>
                    <string>function from Him and deny that it is His? 9 Yet if it is not His it is not yours, for you must lose</string>

                    <string>T-27.II.11. In a split mind, identity must seem to be divided. 2 Nor can anyone perceive a function</string>
                    <string>unified which has conflicting purposes and different ends. 3 Correction, to a mind so split, must be</string>
                    <string>a way to punish sins you think are yours in someone else. 4 And thus does he become your victim,</string>
                    <string>not your brother, different from you in that he is more guilty, thus in need of your correction, as the</string>
                    <string>one more innocent than he. 5 This splits his function off from yours, and gives you both a different</string>
                    <string>role. 6 And so you cannot be perceived as one, and with a single function that would mean a shared</string>
                    <string>identity with but one end.</string>

                    <string>When you perceive correction is the same as pardon, then you also know the Holy Spirit's Mind and</string>
                    <string>yours are One. 3 And so your own Identity is found. 4 Yet must He work with what is given Him,</string>
                    <string>and you allow Him only half your mind. 5 And thus He represents the other half, and seems to have</string>
                    <string>a different purpose from the one you cherish, and you think is yours. 6 Thus does your function</string>
                    <string>seem divided, with a half in opposition to a half. 7 And these two halves appear to represent a split</string>
                    <string>within a self perceived as two.</string>

                    <string>thought extends because that is its purpose, being what it really is. 2 From an idea of self as two,</string>
                    <string>there comes a necessary view of function split between the two. 3 And what you would correct is</string>
                    <string>only half the error, which you think is all of it. 4 Your brother's sins become the central target for</string>
                    <string>correction, lest your errors and his own be seen as one. 5 Yours are mistakes, but his are sins and</string>
                    <string>not the same as yours. 6 His merit punishment, while yours, in fairness, should be overlooked.</string>

                    <string>of correction has been placed outside yourself, on one who cannot be a part of you while this</string>
                    <string>perception lasts. 3 What is condemned can never be returned to its accuser, who had hated it, and</string>
                    <string>hates it still as symbol of his fear. 4 This is your brother, focus of your hate, unworthy to be part of</string>
                    <string>you and thus outside yourself; the other half, which is denied. 5 And only what is left without his</string>
                    <string>presence is perceived as all of you. 6 To this remaining half the Holy Spirit must represent the other</string>
                    <string>half until you recognize it is the other half. 7 And this He does by giving you and him a function</string>
                    <string>that is one, not different.</string>

                    <string>shared, it must correct mistakes in you and him. 3 It cannot leave mistakes in one unhealed and set</string>
                    <string>the other free. 4 That is divided purpose, which can not be shared, and so it cannot be the goal in</string>
                    <string>which the Holy Spirit sees His Own. 5 And you can rest assured that He will not fulfill a function</string>
                    <string>that He does not see and recognize as His. 6 For only thus can He keep yours preserved intact,</string>
                    <string>despite Your separate views of what your function is. 7 If He upheld divided function, you were lost</string>
                    <string>indeed. 8 His inability to see His goal divided and distinct for you and him, preserves yourself from</string>
                    <string>the awareness of a function not your own. 9 And thus is healing given you and him.</string>

                    <string>because it has been shared. 5 In His acceptance of this function lies the means whereby your mind</string>
                    <string>is unified. 6 His single purpose unifies the halves of you that you perceive as separate. 7 And each</string>

                    <string>T-27.III.1. Power cannot oppose. 2 For opposition would weaken it, and weakened power is a</string>
                    <string>contradiction in ideas. 3 Weak strength is meaningless, and power used to weaken is employed to</string>
                    <string>limit. 4 And therefore it must be limited and weak, because that is its purpose. 5 Power is</string>
                    <string>unopposed, to be itself. 6 No weakness can intrude on it without changing it into something it is not.</string>
                    <string>7 To weaken is to limit, and impose an opposite that contradicts the concept that it attacks. 8 And by</string>
                    <string>this does it join to the idea a something it is not, and make it unintelligible. 9 Who can understand a</string>

                    <string>power," and above all, a "living death." 2 And so he has no meaning to you, for he stands for what</string>
                    <string>is meaningless. 3 He represents a double thought, where half is cancelled out by the remaining half.</string>
                    <string>4 Yet even this is quickly contradicted by the half it cancelled out, and so they both are gone. 5 And</string>
                    <string>now he stands for nothing. 6 Symbols which but represent ideas that cannot be must stand for empty</string>
                    <string>space and nothingness. 7 Yet nothingness and empty space can not be interference. 8 What can</string>

                    <string>deny; to love or hate, or to endow with power or to see as weak. 3 The picture has been wholly</string>
                    <string>cancelled out, because it symbolized a contradiction that cancelled out the thought it represents. 4</string>
                    <string>And thus the picture has no cause at all. 5 Who can perceive effect without a cause? 6 What can the</string>
                    <string>causeless be but nothingness? 7 The picture of your brother that you see is wholly absent and has</string>
                    <string>never been. 8 Let, then, the empty space it occupies be recognized as vacant, and the time devoted</string>

                    <string>preparation can be made that would enhance the invitation's real appeal. 3 For what you leave as</string>
                    <string>vacant God will fill, and where He is there must the truth abide. 4 Unweakened power, with no</string>
                    <string>opposite, is what creation is. 5 For this there are no symbols. 6 Nothing points beyond the truth, for</string>
                    <string>what can stand for more than everything? 7 Yet true undoing must be kind. 8 And so the first</string>

                    <string>by which the truth is represented temporarily. 6 It lets the Holy Spirit make exchange of pictures</string>
                    <string>possible, until the time when aids are meaningless and learning done. 7 No learning aid has use that</string>
                    <string>can extend beyond the goal of learning. 8 When its aim has been accomplished it is functionless. 9</string>

                    <string>delay an instant in deciding that it is the only one you want. 4 It does not stand for double concepts.</string>
                    <string>5 Though it is but half the picture and is incomplete, within itself it is the same. 6 The other half of</string>
                    <string>what it represents remains unknown, but is not cancelled out. 7 And thus is God left free to take the</string>
                    <string>final step Himself. 8 For this you need no pictures and no learning aids. 9 And what will ultimately</string>

                    <string>T-27.IV.1. In quietness are all things answered, and is every problem quietly resolved. 2 In conflict</string>
                    <string>there can be no answer and no resolution, for its purpose is to make no resolution possible, and to</string>
                    <string>ensure no answer will be plain. 3 A problem set in conflict has no answer, for it is seen in different</string>
                    <string>ways. 4 And what would be an answer from one point of view is not an answer in another light. 5</string>
                    <string>You are in conflict. 6 Thus it must be clear you cannot answer anything at all, for conflict has no</string>
                    <string>limited effects. 7 Yet if God gave an answer there must be a way in which your problems are</string>
                    <string>resolved, for what He wills already has been done.</string>

                    <string>T-27.IV.2. Thus it must be that time is not involved and every problem can be answered now. 2 Yet</string>
                    <string>it must also be that, in your state of mind, solution is impossible. 3 Therefore, God must have given</string>
                    <string>you a way of reaching to another state of mind in which the answer is already there. 4 Such is the</string>
                    <string>holy instant. 5 It is here that all your problems should be brought and left. 6 Here they belong, for</string>
                    <string>here their answer is. 7 And where its answer is, a problem must be simple and be easily resolved. 8</string>
                    <string>It must be pointless to attempt to solve a problem where the answer cannot be. 9 Yet just as surely</string>
                    <string>it must be resolved, if it is brought to where the answer is.</string>

                    <string>T-27.IV.3. Attempt to solve no problems but within the holy instant's surety. 2 For there the</string>
                    <string>problem will be answered and resolved. 3 Outside there will be no solution, for there is no answer</string>
                    <string>there that could be found. 4 Nowhere outside a single, simple question is ever asked. 5 The world</string>
                    <string>can only ask a double question. 6 One with many answers can have no answers. 7 None of them</string>
                    <string>will do. 8 It does not ask a question to be answered, but only to restate its point of view.</string>

                    <string>T-27.IV.4. All questions asked within this world are but a way of looking, not a question asked. 2 A</string>
                    <string>question asked in hate cannot be answered, because it is an answer in itself. 3 A double question</string>
                    <string>asks and answers, both attesting the same thing in different form. 4 The world asks but one</string>
                    <string>question. 5 It is this: "Of these illusions, which of them is true? 6 Which ones establish peace and</string>
                    <string>offer joy? 7 And which can bring escape from all the pain of which this world is made?" 8</string>
                    <string>Whatever form the question takes, its purpose is the same. 9 It asks but to establish sin is real, and</string>
                    <string>answers in the form of preference. 10 "Which sin do you prefer? 11 That is the one that you should</string>
                    <string>choose. 12 The others are not true. 13 What can the body get that you would want the most of all?</string>
                    <string>14 It is your servant and also your friend. 15 But tell it what you want, and it will serve you</string>
                    <string>lovingly and well." 16 And this is not a question, for it tells you what you want and where to go for</string>
                    <string>it. It leaves no room to question its beliefs, except that what it states takes question's form.</string>

                    <string>T-27.IV.5. A pseudo-question has no answer. 2 It dictates the answer even as it asks. 3 Thus is all</string>
                    <string>questioning within the world a form of propaganda for itself. 4 Just as the body's witnesses are but</string>
                    <string>the senses from within itself, so are the answers to the questions of the world contained within the</string>
                    <string>questions that are asked. 5 Where answers represent the questions, they add nothing new and</string>
                    <string>nothing has been learned. 6 An honest question is a learning tool that asks for something that you do</string>
                    <string>not know. 7 It does not set conditions for response, but merely asks what the response should be. 8</string>
                    <string>But no one in a conflict state is free to ask this question, for he does not want an honest answer</string>
                    <string>where the conflict ends.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-27.IV.6. Only within the holy instant can an honest question honestly be asked. 2 And from the</string>
                    <string>meaning of the question does the meaningfulness of the answer come. 3 Here is it possible to</string>
                    <string>separate your wishes from the answer, so it can be given you and also be received. 4 The answer is</string>
                    <string>provided everywhere. 5 Yet it is only here it can be heard. 6 An honest answer asks no sacrifice</string>
                    <string>because it answers questions truly asked. 7 The questions of the world but ask of whom is sacrifice</string>
                    <string>demanded, asking not if sacrifice is meaningful at all. 8 And so, unless the answer tells "of whom,"</string>
                    <string>it will remain unrecognized, unheard, and thus the question is preserved intact because it gave the</string>
                    <string>answer to itself. 9 The holy instant is the interval in which the mind is still enough to hear an</string>
                    <string>answer that is not entailed within the question asked. 10 It offers something new and different from</string>
                    <string>the question. 11 How could it be answered if it but repeats itself?</string>
                  </ACIMParagraph>

                    <string>T-27.IV.7. Therefore, attempt to solve no problems in a world from which the answer has been</string>
                    <string>barred. 2 But bring the problem to the only place that holds the answer lovingly for you. 3 Here are</string>
                    <string>the answers that will solve your problems because they stand apart from them, and see what can be</string>
                    <string>answered; what the question is. 4 Within the world the answers merely raise another question,</string>
                    <string>though they leave the first unanswered. 5 In the holy instant, you can bring the question to the</string>
                    <string>answer, and receive the answer that was made for you.</string>

                    <string>T-27.V.1. The only way to heal is to be healed. 2 The miracle extends without your help, but you</string>
                    <string>are needed that it can begin. 3 Accept the miracle of healing, and it will go forth because of what it</string>
                    <string>is. 4 It is its nature to extend itself the instant it is born. 5 And it is born the instant it is offered and</string>
                    <string>received. 6 No one can ask another to be healed. 7 But he can let himself be healed, and thus offer</string>
                    <string>the other what he has received. 8 Who can bestow upon another what he does not have? 9 And who</string>
                    <string>can share what he denies himself? 10 The Holy Spirit speaks to you. 11 He does not speak to</string>
                    <string>someone else. 12 Yet by your listening His Voice extends, because you have accepted what He says.</string>

                    <string>T-27.V.2. Health is the witness unto health. 2 As long as it is unattested, it remains without</string>
                    <string>conviction. 3 Only when it has been demonstrated is it proved, and must provide a witness that</string>
                    <string>compels belief. 4 No one is healed through double messages. 5 If you wish only to be healed, you</string>
                    <string>heal. 6 Your single purpose makes this possible. 7 But if you are afraid of healing, then it cannot</string>
                    <string>come through you. 8 The only thing that is required for a healing is a lack of fear. 9 The fearful are</string>
                    <string>not healed, and cannot heal. 10 This does not mean the conflict must be gone forever from your</string>
                    <string>mind to heal. 11 For if it were, there were no need for healing then. 12 But it does mean, if only for</string>
                    <string>an instant, you love without attack. 13 An instant is sufficient. 14 Miracles wait not on time.</string>

                    <string>T-27.V.3. The holy instant is the miracle's abiding place. 2 From there, each one is born into this</string>
                    <string>world as witness to a state of mind that has transcended conflict, and has reached to peace. 3 It</string>
                    <string>carries comfort from the place of peace into the battleground, and demonstrates that war has no</string>
                    <string>effects. 4 For all the hurt that war has sought to bring, the broken bodies and the shattered limbs, the</string>
                    <string>screaming dying and the silent dead, are gently lifted up and comforted.</string>

                    <string>T-27.V.4. There is no sadness where a miracle has come to heal. 2 And nothing more than just one</string>
                    <string>instant of your love without attack is necessary that all this occur. 3 In that one instant you are</string>
                    <string>healed, and in that single instant is all healing done. 4 What stands apart from you, when you accept</string>
                    <string>the blessing that the holy instant brings? 5 Be not afraid of blessing, for the One Who blesses you</string>
                    <string>loves all the world, and leaves nothing within the world that could be feared. 6 But if you shrink</string>
                    <string>from blessing, will the world indeed seem fearful, for you have withheld its peace and comfort,</string>
                    <string>leaving it to die.</string>

                    <string>T-27.V.5. Would not a world so bitterly bereft be looked on as a condemnation by the one who</string>
                    <string>could have saved it, but stepped back because he was afraid of being healed? 2 The eyes of all the</string>
                    <string>dying bring reproach, and suffering whispers, "What is there to fear?" 3 Consider well its question.</string>
                    <string>4 It is asked of you on your behalf. 5 A dying world asks only that you rest an instant from attack</string>
                    <string>upon yourself, that it be healed.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-27.V.6. Come to the holy instant and be healed, for nothing that is there received is left behind on</string>
                    <string>your returning to the world. 2 And being blessed you will bring blessing. 3 Life is given you to give</string>
                    <string>the dying world. 4 And suffering eyes no longer will accuse, but shine in thanks to you who blessing</string>
                    <string>gave. 5 The holy instant's radiance will light your eyes, and give them sight to see beyond all</string>
                    <string>suffering and see Christ's face instead. 6 Healing replaces suffering. 7 Who looks on one cannot</string>
                    <string>perceive the other, for they cannot both be there. 8 And what you see the world will witness, and</string>
                    <string>will witness to.</string>

                    <string>T-27.V.7. Thus is your healing everything the world requires, that it may be healed. 2 It needs one</string>
                    <string>lesson that has perfectly been learned. 3 And then, when you forget it, will the world remind you</string>
                    <string>gently of what you have taught. 4 No reinforcement will its thanks withhold from you who let</string>
                    <string>yourself be healed that it might live. 5 It will call forth its witnesses to show the face of Christ to</string>
                    <string>you who brought the sight to them, by which they witnessed it. 6 The world of accusation is</string>
                    <string>replaced by one in which all eyes look lovingly upon the Friend who brought them their release. 7</string>
                    <string>And happily your brother will perceive the many friends he thought were enemies.</string>

                    <string>T-27.V.8. Problems are not specific but they take specific forms, and these specific shapes make up</string>
                    <string>the world. 2 And no one understands the nature of his problem. 3 If he did, it would be there no</string>
                    <string>more for him to see. 4 Its very nature is that it is not. 5 And thus, while he perceives it he can not</string>
                    <string>perceive it as it is. 6 But healing is apparent in specific instances, and generalizes to include them</string>
                    <string>all. 7 This is because they really are the same, despite their different forms. 8 All learning aims at</string>
                    <string>transfer, which becomes complete within two situations that are seen as one, for only common</string>
                    <string>elements are there. 9 Yet this can only be attained by One Who does not see the differences you see.</string>
                    <string>10 The total transfer of your learning is not made by you. 11 But that it has been made in spite of all</string>
                    <string>the differences you see, convinces you that they could not be real.</string>

                    <string>T-27.V.9. Your healing will extend, and will be brought to problems that you thought were not your</string>
                    <string>own. 2 And it will also be apparent that your many different problems will be solved as any one of</string>
                    <string>them has been escaped. 3 It cannot be their differences which made this possible, for learning does</string>
                    <string>not jump from situations to their opposites and bring the same results. 4 All healing must proceed in</string>
                    <string>lawful manner, in accord with laws that have been properly perceived but never violated. 5 Fear you</string>
                    <string>not the way that you perceive them. 6 You are wrong, but there is One within you Who is right.</string>

                    <string>and Who will guarantee that they remain unviolated and unlimited. 2 Your part is merely to apply</string>
                    <string>what He has taught you to yourself, and He will do the rest. 3 And it is thus the power of your</string>
                    <string>learning will be proved to you by all the many different witnesses it finds. 4 Your brother first</string>
                    <string>among them will be seen, but thousands stand behind him, and beyond each one of them there are a</string>
                    <string>thousand more. 5 Each one may seem to have a problem that is different from the rest. 6 Yet they</string>
                    <string>are solved together. 7 And their common answer shows the questions could not have been separate.</string>

                    <string>when you accept the healing for yourself. 3 Its total value need not be appraised by you to let you</string>
                    <string>understand that you have benefited from it. 4 What occurred within the instant that love entered in</string>
                    <string>without attack will stay with you forever. 5 Your healing will be one of its effects, as will your</string>
                    <string>brother's. 6 Everywhere you go, will you behold its multiplied effects. 7 Yet all the witnesses that</string>
                    <string>you behold will be far less than all there really are. 8 Infinity cannot be understood by merely</string>

                    <string>would silence what the Holy Spirit says, and keep His words from your awareness. 3 Pain compels</string>
                    <string>attention, drawing it away from Him and focusing upon itself. 4 Its purpose is the same as pleasure,</string>
                    <string>for they both are means to make the body real. 5 What shares a common purpose is the same. 6 This</string>
                    <string>is the law of purpose, which unites all those who share in it within itself. 7 Pleasure and pain are</string>
                    <string>equally unreal, because their purpose cannot be achieved. 8 Thus are they means for nothing, for</string>
                    <string>they have a goal without a meaning. 9 And they share the lack of meaning which their purpose has.</string>

                    <string>T-27.VI.2. Sin shifts from pain to pleasure, and again to pain. 2 For either witness is the same, and</string>
                    <string>carries but one message: "You are here, within this body, and you can be hurt. 3 You can have</string>
                    <string>pleasure, too, but only at the cost of pain." 4 These witnesses are joined by many more. 5 Each one</string>
                    <string>seems different because it has a different name, and so it seems to answer to a different sound. 6</string>
                    <string>Except for this, the witnesses of sin are all alike. 7 Call pleasure pain, and it will hurt. 8 Call pain a</string>
                    <string>pleasure, and the pain behind the pleasure will be felt no more. 9 Sin's witnesses but shift from</string>
                    <string>name to name, as one steps forward and another back. 10 Yet which is foremost makes no</string>
                    <string>difference. 11 Sin's witnesses hear but the call of death.</string>

                    <string>use its eyes to see, its ears to hear, and let it tell you what it is it feels. 3 It does not know. 4 It tells</string>
                    <string>you but the names you gave to it to use, when you call forth the witnesses to its reality. 5 You</string>
                    <string>cannot choose among them which are real, for any one you choose is like the rest. 6 This name or</string>
                    <string>that, but nothing more, you choose. 7 You do not make a witness true because you called him by</string>
                    <string>truth's name. 8 The truth is found in him if it is truth he represents. 9 And otherwise he lies, if you</string>

                    <string>witnesses by other names that speak in other ways for its reality. 3 He knows it is not real. 4 For</string>
                    <string>nothing could contain what you believe it holds within. 5 Nor could it tell a part of God Himself</string>
                    <string>what it should feel and what its function is. 6 Yet must He love whatever you hold dear. 7 And for</string>
                    <string>each witness to the body's death He sends a witness to your life in Him Who knows no death. 8</string>
                    <string>Each miracle He brings is witness that the body is not real. 9 Its pains and pleasures does He heal</string>

                    <string>T-27.VI.5. The miracle makes no distinctions in the names by which sin's witnesses are called. 2 It</string>
                    <string>merely proves that what they represent has no effects. 3 And this it proves because its own effects</string>
                    <string>have come to take their place. 4 It matters not the name by which you called your suffering. 5 It is</string>
                    <string>no longer there. 6 The One Who brings the miracle perceives them all as one, and called by name of</string>
                    <string>fear. 7 As fear is witness unto death, so is the miracle the witness unto life. 8 It is a witness no one</string>
                    <string>can deny, for it is the effects of life it brings. 9 The dying live, the dead arise, and pain has</string>
                    <string>vanished. 10 Yet a miracle speaks not but for itself, but what it represents.</string>

                    <string>T-27.VI.6. Love, too, has symbols in a world of sin. 2 The miracle forgives because it stands for</string>
                    <string>what is past forgiveness and is true. 3 How foolish and insane it is to think a miracle is bound by</string>
                    <string>laws that it came solely to undo! 4 The laws of sin have different witnesses with different strengths.</string>
                    <string>5 And they attest to different sufferings. 6 Yet to the One Who sends forth miracles to bless the</string>
                    <string>world, a tiny stab of pain, a little worldly pleasure, and the throes of death itself are but a single</string>
                    <string>sound; a call for healing, and a plaintive cry for help within a world of misery. 7 It is their sameness</string>
                    <string>that the miracle attests. 8 It is their sameness that it proves. 9 The laws that call them different are</string>
                    <string>dissolved, and shown as powerless. 10 The purpose of a miracle is to accomplish this. 11 And God</string>
                    <string>Himself has guaranteed the strength of miracles for what they witness to.</string>

                    <string>any more. 3 But there is need that you be healed, because the suffering and sorrow of the world</string>

                    <string>this? 5 Be healed that you may heal, and suffer not the laws of sin to be applied to you. 6 And truth</string>
                    <string>will be revealed to you who chose to let love's symbols take the place of sin.</string>

                    <string>world's demented version of salvation clearly shown. 3 Like to a dream of punishment, in which the</string>
                    <string>dreamer is unconscious of what brought on the attack against himself, he sees himself attacked</string>
                    <string>unjustly and by something not himself. 4 He is the victim of this "something else," a thing outside</string>
                    <string>himself, for which he has no reason to be held responsible. 5 He must be innocent because he</string>
                    <string>knows not what he does, but what is done to him. 6 Yet is his own attack upon himself apparent</string>
                    <string>still, for it is he who bears the suffering. 7 And he cannot escape because its source is seen outside</string>
                    <string>himself.</string>

                    <string>problem as it is, and not the way that you have set it up. 3 How could there be another way to solve</string>
                    <string>a problem that is very simple, but has been obscured by heavy clouds of complication, which were</string>
                    <string>made to keep the problem unresolved? 4 Without the clouds the problem will emerge in all its</string>
                    <string>primitive simplicity. 5 The choice will not be difficult, because the problem is absurd when clearly</string>
                    <string>seen. 6 No one has difficulty making up his mind to let a simple problem be resolved if it is seen as</string>
                    <string>hurting him, and also very easily removed.</string>

                    <string>maintained, is simply this: "You are the cause of what I do. 2 Your presence justifies my wrath, and</string>
                    <string>you exist and think apart from me. 3 While you attack I must be innocent. 4 And what I suffer from</string>
                    <string>is your attack." 5 No one who looks upon this "reasoning" exactly as it is could fail to see it does</string>
                    <string>not follow and it makes no sense. 6 Yet it seems sensible, because it looks as if the world were</string>
                    <string>hurting you. 7 And so it seems as if there is no need to go beyond the obvious in terms of cause.</string>

                    <string>within the world are joined in sharing. 3 Yet they do not recognize their common need. 4 For each</string>
                    <string>one thinks that if he does his part, the condemnation of the world will rest on him. 5 And it is this</string>
                    <string>that he perceives to be his part in its deliverance. 6 Vengeance must have a focus. 7 Otherwise is the</string>
                    <string>avenger's knife in his own hand, and pointed to himself. 8 And he must see it in another's hand, if</string>
                    <string>he would be a victim of attack he did not choose. 9 And thus he suffers from the wounds a knife he</string>

                    <string>means by which this purpose seems to be fulfilled. 3 The means attest the purpose, but are not</string>
                    <string>themselves a cause. 4 Nor will the cause be changed by seeing it apart from its effects. 5 The cause</string>
                    <string>produces the effects, which then bear witness to the cause, and not themselves. 6 Look, then,</string>
                    <string>beyond effects. 7 It is not here the cause of suffering and sin must lie. 8 And dwell not on the</string>

                    <string>the first attack upon yourself begun. 5 And it is this the world bears witness to. 6 Seek not another</string>
                    <string>cause, nor look among the mighty legions of its witnesses for its undoing. 7 They support its claim</string>

                    <string>depend on him. 8 Whatever cause they have is something quite apart from him, and what he sees is</string>
                    <string>separate from his mind. 9 He cannot doubt his dreams' reality, because he does not see the part he</string>

                    <string>T-27.VIII.1. The body is the central figure in the dreaming of the world. 2 There is no dream</string>
                    <string>without it, nor does it exist without the dream in which it acts as if it were a person to be seen and</string>
                    <string>be believed. 3 It takes the central place in every dream, which tells the story of how it was made by</string>
                    <string>other bodies, born into the world outside the body, lives a little while and dies, to be united in the</string>
                    <string>dust with other bodies dying like itself. 4 In the brief time allotted it to live, it seeks for other bodies</string>
                    <string>as its friends and enemies. 5 Its safety is its main concern. 6 Its comfort is its guiding rule. 7 It tries</string>
                    <string>to look for pleasure, and avoid the things that would be hurtful. 8 Above all, it tries to teach itself its</string>
                    <string>pains and joys are different and can be told apart.</string>

                    <string>T-27.VIII.2. The dreaming of the world takes many forms, because the body seeks in many ways to</string>
                    <string>prove it is autonomous and real. 2 It puts things on itself that it has bought with little metal discs or</string>
                    <string>paper strips the world proclaims as valuable and real. 3 It works to get them, doing senseless things,</string>
                    <string>and tosses them away for senseless things it does not need and does not even want. 4 It hires other</string>
                    <string>bodies, that they may protect it and collect more senseless things that it can call its own. 5 It looks</string>
                    <string>about for special bodies that can share its dream. 6 Sometimes it dreams it is a conqueror of bodies</string>
                    <string>weaker than itself. 7 But in some phases of the dream, it is the slave of bodies that would hurt and</string>
                    <string>torture it.</string>

                    <string>dream the world has ever had. 2 The "hero" of this dream will never change, nor will its purpose. 3</string>
                    <string>Though the dream itself takes many forms, and seems to show a great variety of places and events</string>
                    <string>wherein its "hero" finds itself, the dream has but one purpose, taught in many ways. 4 This single</string>
                    <string>lesson does it try to teach again, and still again, and yet once more; that it is cause and not effect. 5</string>
                    <string>And you are its effect, and cannot be its cause.</string>

                    <string>dream. 4 But who reacts to figures in a dream unless he sees them as if they were real? 5 The instant</string>
                    <string>that he sees them as they are they have no more effects on him, because he understands he gave</string>

                    <string>your wish to let no dream appear to be the cause of what it is you do? 3 Then let us merely look</string>
                    <string>upon the dream's beginning, for the part you see is but the second part, whose cause lies in the first.</string>
                    <string>4 No one asleep and dreaming in the world remembers his attack upon himself. 5 No one believes</string>
                    <string>there really was a time when he knew nothing of a body, and could never have conceived this world</string>
                    <string>as real. 6 He would have seen at once that these ideas are one illusion, too ridiculous for anything</string>
                    <string>but to be laughed away. 7 How serious they now appear to be! 8 And no one can remember when</string>
                    <string>they would have met with laughter and with disbelief. 9 We can remember this, if we but look</string>
                    <string>directly at their cause. 10 And we will see the grounds for laughter, not a cause for fear.</string>

                    <string>separate from himself and done to him. 2 Into eternity, where all is one, there crept a tiny, mad idea,</string>
                    <string>at which the Son of God remembered not to laugh. 3 In his forgetting did the thought become a</string>
                    <string>serious idea, and possible of both accomplishment and real effects. 4 Together, we can laugh them</string>
                    <string>both away, and understand that time cannot intrude upon eternity. 5 It is a joke to think that time can</string>
                    <string>come to circumvent eternity, which means there is no time.</string>

                    <string>at its beginning, ending at its cause. 2 The world you see depicts exactly what you thought you did.</string>
                    <string>3 Except that now you think that what you did is being done to you. 4 The guilt for what you</string>
                    <string>thought is being placed outside yourself, and on a guilty world that dreams your dreams and thinks</string>
                    <string>your thoughts instead of you. 5 It brings its vengeance, not your own. 6 It keeps you narrowly</string>
                    <string>confined within a body, which it punishes because of all the sinful things the body does within its</string>
                    <string>dream. 7 You have no power to make the body stop its evil deeds because you did not make it, and</string>

                    <string>exactly what you think you did to them. 2 But once deluded into blaming them you will not see the</string>
                    <string>cause of what they do, because you want the guilt to rest on them. 3 How childish is the petulant</string>
                    <string>device to keep your innocence by pushing guilt outside yourself, but never letting go! 4 It is not</string>
                    <string>easy to perceive the jest when all around you do your eyes behold its heavy consequences, but</string>
                    <string>without their trifling cause. 5 Without the cause do its effects seem serious and sad indeed. 6 Yet</string>
                    <string>they but follow. 7 And it is their cause that follows nothing and is but a jest.</string>

                    <string>each terrible effect to Him that you may look together on its foolish cause and laugh with Him a</string>
                    <string>while. 4 You judge effects, but He has judged their cause. 5 And by His judgment are effects</string>
                    <string>removed. 6 Perhaps you come in tears. 7 But hear Him say, "My brother, holy Son of God, behold</string>
                    <string>your idle dream, in which this could occur." 8 And you will leave the holy instant with your</string>

                    <string>T-28.I.1. The miracle does nothing. 2 All it does is to undo. 3 And thus it cancels out the</string>
                    <string>interference to what has been done. 4 It does not add, but merely takes away. 5 And what it takes</string>
                    <string>away is long since gone, but being kept in memory appears to have immediate effects. 6 This world</string>
                    <string>was over long ago. 7 The thoughts that made it are no longer in the mind that thought of them and</string>
                    <string>loved them for a little while. 8 The miracle but shows the past is gone, and what has truly gone has</string>
                    <string>no effects. 9 Remembering a cause can but produce illusions of its presence, not effects.</string>

                    <string>T-28.I.2. All the effects of guilt are here no more. 2 For guilt is over. 3 In its passing went its</string>
                    <string>consequences, left without a cause. 4 Why would you cling to it in memory if you did not desire its</string>
                    <string>effects? 5 Remembering is as selective as perception, being its past tense. 6 It is perception of the</string>
                    <string>past as if it were occurring now, and still were there to see. 7 Memory, like perception, is a skill</string>
                    <string>made up by you to take the place of what God gave in your creation. 8 And like all the things you</string>
                    <string>made, it can be used to serve another purpose, and to be the means for something else. 9 It can be</string>
                    <string>used to heal and not to hurt, if you so wish it be.</string>

                    <string>T-28.I.3. Nothing employed for healing represents an effort to do anything at all. 2 It is a</string>
                    <string>recognition that you have no needs which mean that something must be done. 3 It is an unselective</string>
                    <string>memory, that is not used to interfere with truth. 4 All things the Holy Spirit can employ for healing</string>
                    <string>have been given Him, without the content and the purposes for which they have been made. 5 They</string>
                    <string>are but skills without an application. 6 They await their use. 7 They have no dedication and no aim.</string>

                    <string>T-28.I.4. The Holy Spirit can indeed make use of memory, for God Himself is there. 2 Yet this is</string>
                    <string>not a memory of past events, but only of a present state. 3 You are so long accustomed to believe</string>
                    <string>that memory holds only what is past, that it is hard for you to realize it is a skill that can remember</string>
                    <string>now. 4 The limitations on remembering the world imposes on it are as vast as those you let the</string>
                    <string>world impose on you. 5 There is no link of memory to the past. 6 If you would have it there, then</string>
                    <string>there it is. 7 But only your desire made the link, and only you have held it to a part of time where</string>
                    <string>guilt appears to linger still.</string>

                    <string>T-28.I.5. The Holy Spirit's use of memory is quite apart from time. 2 He does not seek to use it as a</string>
                    <string>means to keep the past, but rather as a way to let it go. 3 Memory holds the message it receives, and</string>
                    <string>does what it is given it to do. 4 It does not write the message, nor appoint what it is for. 5 Like to</string>
                    <string>the body, it is purposeless within itself. 6 And if it seems to serve to cherish ancient hate, and gives</string>
                    <string>you pictures of injustices and hurts that you were saving, this is what you asked its message be and</string>
                    <string>that it is. 7 Committed to its vaults, the history of all the body's past is hidden there. 8 All of the</string>
                    <string>strange associations made to keep the past alive, the present dead, are stored within it, waiting your</string>
                    <string>command that they be brought to you, and lived again. 9 And thus do their effects appear to be</string>
                    <string>increased by time, which took away their cause.</string>

                    <string>T-28.I.6. Yet time is but another phase of what does nothing. 2 It works hand in hand with all the</string>
                    <string>other attributes with which you seek to keep concealed the truth about yourself. 3 Time neither takes</string>
                    <string>away nor can restore. 4 And yet you make strange use of it, as if the past had caused the present,</string>
                    <string>which is but a consequence in which no change can be made possible because its cause has gone. 5</string>
                    <string>Yet change must have a cause that will endure, or else it will not last. 6 No change can be made in</string>
                    <string>the present if its cause is past. 7 Only the past is held in memory as you make use of it, and so it is a</string>
                    <string>way to hold the past against the now.</string>

                    <string>T-28.I.7. Remember nothing that you taught yourself, for you were badly taught. 2 And who would</string>
                    <string>keep a senseless lesson in his mind, when he can learn and can preserve a better one? 3 When</string>
                    <string>ancient memories of hate appear, remember that their cause is gone. 4 And so you cannot</string>
                    <string>understand what they are for. 5 Let not the cause that you would give them now be what it was that</string>
                    <string>made them what they were, or seemed to be. 6 Be glad that it is gone, for this is what you would be</string>
                    <string>pardoned from. 7 And see, instead, the new effects of cause accepted now, with consequences here.</string>
                    <string>8 They will surprise you with their loveliness. 9 The ancient new ideas they bring will be the happy</string>
                    <string>consequences of a Cause so ancient that It far exceeds the span of memory which your perception</string>
                    <string>sees.</string>

                    <string>T-28.I.8. This is the Cause the Holy Spirit has remembered for you, when you would forget. 2 It is</string>
                    <string>not past because He let It not be unremembered. 3 It has never changed, because there never was a</string>
                    <string>time in which He did not keep It safely in your mind. 4 Its consequences will indeed seem new,</string>
                    <string>because you thought that you remembered not their Cause. 5 Yet was It never absent from your</string>
                    <string>mind, for it was not your Father's Will that He be unremembered by His Son.</string>

                    <string>T-28.I.9. What you remember never was. 2 It came from causelessness which you confused with</string>
                    <string>cause. 3 It can deserve but laughter, when you learn you have remembered consequences that were</string>
                    <string>causeless and could never be effects. 4 The miracle reminds you of a Cause forever present,</string>
                    <string>perfectly untouched by time and interference. 5 Never changed from what It is. 6 And you are Its</string>
                    <string>Effect, as changeless and as perfect as Itself. 7 Its memory does not lie in the past, nor waits the</string>
                    <string>future. 8 It is not revealed in miracles. 9 They but remind you that It has not gone. 10 When you</string>
                    <string>forgive It for your sins, It will no longer be denied.</string>

                    <string>He Who laid a judgment on His Son. 2 You would deny Him His Effects, yet have They never been</string>
                    <string>denied. 3 There was no time in which His Son could be condemned for what was causeless and</string>
                    <string>against His Will. 4 What your remembering would witness to is but the fear of God. 5 He has not</string>
                    <string>done the thing you fear. 6 No more have you. 7 And so your innocence has not been lost. 8 You</string>
                    <string>need no healing to be healed. 9 In quietness, see in the miracle a lesson in allowing Cause to have</string>
                    <string>Its Own Effects, and doing nothing that would interfere.</string>

                    <string>T-28.I.11. The miracle comes quietly into the mind that stops an instant and is still. 2 It reaches</string>
                    <string>gently from that quiet time, and from the mind it healed in quiet then, to other minds to share its</string>
                    <string>quietness. 3 And they will join in doing nothing to prevent its radiant extension back into the Mind</string>
                    <string>which caused all minds to be. 4 Born out of sharing, there can be no pause in time to cause the</string>
                    <string>miracle delay in hastening to all unquiet minds, and bringing them an instant's stillness, when the</string>
                    <string>memory of God returns to them. 5 Their own remembering is quiet now, and what has come to take</string>
                    <string>its place will not be wholly unremembered afterwards.</string>

                    <string>instant is God's memory allowed to offer all its treasures to the Son of God, for whom they have</string>
                    <string>been kept. 3 How gladly does He offer them unto the one for whom He has been given them! 4 And</string>
                    <string>His Creator shares His thanks, because He would not be deprived of His Effects. 5 The instant's</string>
                    <string>silence that His Son accepts gives welcome to eternity and Him, and lets Them enter where They</string>
                    <string>would abide. 6 For in that instant does the Son of God do nothing that would make himself afraid.</string>

                    <string>away! 2 Its own remembering has gone. 3 There is no past to keep its fearful image in the way of</string>
                    <string>glad awakening to present peace. 4 The trumpets of eternity resound throughout the stillness, yet</string>
                    <string>disturb it not. 5 And what is now remembered is not fear, but rather is the Cause that fear was made</string>
                    <string>to render unremembered and undone. 6 The stillness speaks in gentle sounds of love the Son of God</string>
                    <string>remembers from before his own remembering came in between the present and the past, to shut</string>

                    <string>in seeing this, he understands he never had a need for doing anything, and never did. 5 His Cause is</string>
                    <string>Its Effects. 6 There never was a cause beside It that could generate a different past or future. 7 Its</string>

                    <string>cause a cause is made by its effects; the Father is a Father by His Son. 3 Effects do not create their</string>
                    <string>cause, but they establish its causation. 4 Thus, the Son gives Fatherhood to his Creator, and receives</string>
                    <string>the gift that he has given Him. 5 It is because he is God's Son that he must also be a father, who</string>
                    <string>creates as God created him. 6 The circle of creation has no end. 7 Its starting and its ending are the</string>

                    <string>of the body. 6 Nor can it be found where limitation is. 7 The body can be healed by its effects,</string>
                    <string>which are as limitless as is itself. 8 Yet must all healing come about because the mind is recognized</string>
                    <string>as not within the body, and its innocence is quite apart from it, and where all healing is. 9 Where,</string>
                    <string>then, is healing? 10 Only where its cause is given its effects. 11 For sickness is a meaningless</string>

                    <string>in which you were an alien to yourself, and but a part of someone else's dream. 2 The miracle does</string>
                    <string>not awaken you, but merely shows you who the dreamer is. 3 It teaches you there is a choice of</string>
                    <string>dreams while you are still asleep, depending on the purpose of your dreaming. 4 Do you wish for</string>
                    <string>dreams of healing, or for dreams of death? 5 A dream is like a memory in that it pictures what you</string>
                    <string>wanted shown to you.</string>

                    <string>2 Yet if you are the dreamer, you perceive this much at least: that you have caused the dream, and</string>
                    <string>can accept another dream as well. 3 But for this change in content of the dream, it must be realized</string>
                    <string>that it is you who dreamed the dreaming that you do not like. 4 It is but an effect that you have</string>
                    <string>caused, and you would not be cause of this effect. 5 In dreams of murder and attack are you the</string>
                    <string>victim in a dying body slain. 6 But in forgiving dreams is no one asked to be the victim and the</string>
                    <string>sufferer. 7 These are the happy dreams the miracle exchanges for your own. 8 It does not ask you</string>
                    <string>make another; only that you see you made the one you would exchange for this.</string>

                    <string>No plans are possible, and no design exists that could be found and understood. 3 What else could</string>
                    <string>be expected from a thing that has no cause? 4 Yet if it has no cause, it has no purpose. 5 You may</string>
                    <string>cause a dream, but never will you give it real effects. 6 For that would change its cause, and it is this</string>
                    <string>you cannot do. 7 The dreamer of a dream is not awake, but does not know he sleeps. 8 He sees</string>
                    <string>illusions of himself as sick or well, depressed or happy, but without a stable cause with guaranteed</string>
                    <string>effects.</string>

                    <string>T-28.II.7. The miracle establishes you dream a dream, and that its content is not true. 2 This is a</string>
                    <string>crucial step in dealing with illusions. 3 No one is afraid of them when he perceives he made them</string>
                    <string>up. 4 The fear was held in place because he did not see that he was author of the dream, and not a</string>
                    <string>figure in the dream. 5 He gives himself the consequences that he dreams he gave his brother. 6 And</string>
                    <string>it is but this the dream has put together and has offered him, to show him that his wishes have been</string>
                    <string>done. 7 Thus does he fear his own attack, but sees it at another's hands. 8 As victim, he is suffering</string>
                    <string>from its effects, but not their cause. 9 He authored not his own attack, and he is innocent of what he</string>
                    <string>caused. 10 The miracle does nothing but to show him that he has done nothing. 11 What he fears is</string>
                    <string>cause without the consequences that would make it cause. 12 And so it never was.</string>

                    <string>T-28.II.8. The separation started with the dream the Father was deprived of His Effects, and</string>
                    <string>powerless to keep them since He was no longer their Creator. 2 In the dream, the dreamer made</string>
                    <string>himself. 3 But what he made has turned against him, taking on the role of its creator, as the dreamer</string>
                    <string>had. 4 And as he hated his Creator, so the figures in the dream have hated him. 5 His body is their</string>
                    <string>slave, which they abuse because the motives he has given it have they adopted as their own. 6 And</string>
                    <string>hate it for the vengeance it would offer them. 7 It is their vengeance on the body which appears to</string>
                    <string>prove the dreamer could not be the maker of the dream. 8 Effect and cause are first split off, and</string>
                    <string>then reversed, so that effect becomes a cause; the cause, effect./p&gt;</string>

                    <string>way, begins. 2 This final step is an effect of what has gone before, appearing as a cause. 3 The</string>
                    <string>miracle is the first step in giving back to cause the function of causation, not effect. 4 For this</string>
                    <string>confusion has produced the dream, and while it lasts will wakening be feared. 5 Nor will the call to</string>
                    <string>wakening be heard, because it seems to be the call to fear.</string>

                    <string>demonstrates what He would have you learn, and shows you its effects are what you want. 3 In His</string>
                    <string>forgiving dreams are the effects of yours undone, and hated enemies perceived as friends with</string>
                    <string>merciful intent. 4 Their enmity is seen as causeless now, because they did not make it. 5 And you</string>
                    <string>can accept the role of maker of their hate, because you see that it has no effects. 6 Now are you</string>
                    <string>freed from this much of the dream; the world is neutral, and the bodies that still seem to move about</string>
                    <string>as separate things need not be feared. 7 And so they are not sick.</string>

                    <string>T-28.II.11. The miracle returns the cause of fear to you who made it. 2 But it also shows that,</string>
                    <string>having no effects, it is not cause, because the function of causation is to have effects. 3 And where</string>
                    <string>effects are gone, there is no cause. 4 Thus is the body healed by miracles because they show the</string>
                    <string>mind made sickness, and employed the body to be victim, or effect, of what it made. 5 Yet half the</string>
                    <string>lesson will not teach the whole. 6 The miracle is useless if you learn but that the body can be healed,</string>
                    <string>for this is not the lesson it was sent to teach. 7 The lesson is the mind was sick that thought the body</string>
                    <string>could be sick; projecting out its guilt caused nothing, and had no effects.</string>

                    <string>pain and suffering, of sin and guilt. 3 They are the dream's alternative, the choice to be the dreamer,</string>
                    <string>rather than deny the active role in making up the dream. 4 They are the glad effects of taking back</string>
                    <string>the consequence of sickness to its cause. 5 The body is released because the mind acknowledges</string>
                    <string>"this is not done to me, but I am doing this." 6 And thus the mind is free to make another choice</string>
                    <string>instead. 7 Beginning here, salvation will proceed to change the course of every step in the descent to</string>
                    <string>separation, until all the steps have been retraced, the ladder gone, and all the dreaming of the world</string>

                    <string>down. 3 The miracle alone is your concern at present. 4 Here is where we must begin. 5 And having</string>
                    <string>started, will the way be made serene and simple in the rising up to waking and the ending of the</string>
                    <string>dream. 6 When you accept a miracle, you do not add your dream of fear to one that is already being</string>
                    <string>dreamed. 7 Without support, the dream will fade away without effects. 8 For it is your support that</string>

                    <string>joint decision to be sick. 3 If you withhold agreement and accept the part you play in making</string>
                    <string>sickness real, the other mind cannot project its guilt without your aid in letting it perceive itself as</string>
                    <string>separate and apart from you. 4 Thus is the body not perceived as sick by both your minds from</string>
                    <string>separate points of view. 5 Uniting with a brother's mind prevents the cause of sickness and</string>
                    <string>perceived effects. 6 Healing is the effect of minds that join, as sickness comes from minds that</string>

                    <string>in the dreaming has this been reversed, and separate minds are seen as bodies, which are separated</string>
                    <string>and which cannot join. 3 Do not allow your brother to be sick, for if he is, have you abandoned him</string>
                    <string>to his own dream by sharing it with him. 4 He has not seen the cause of sickness where it is, and</string>
                    <string>you have overlooked the gap between you, where the sickness has been bred. 5 Thus are you joined</string>
                    <string>in sickness, to preserve the little gap unhealed, where sickness is kept carefully protected, cherished,</string>
                    <string>and upheld by firm belief, lest God should come to bridge the little gap that leads to Him. 6 Fight</string>
                    <string>not His coming with illusions, for it is His coming that you want above all things that seem to</string>

                    <string>gap is little. 3 Yet it holds the seeds of pestilence and every form of ill, because it is a wish to keep</string>
                    <string>apart and not to join. 4 And thus it seems to give a cause to sickness which is not its cause. 5 The</string>
                    <string>purpose of the gap is all the cause that sickness has. 6 For it was made to keep you separated, in a</string>

                    <string>the gap, and as the waves in joining cover it. 4 Where is the gap between the waves when they have</string>

                    <string>And you are free of dreams of pain because you let him be. 6 Unless you help him, you will suffer</string>
                    <string>pain with him because that is your wish. 7 And you become a figure in his dream of pain, as he in</string>
                    <string>yours. 8 So do you and your brother both become illusions, and without identity. 9 You could be</string>

                    <string>apart from its foundation. 10 If it rests on straw, there is no need to bar the door and lock the</string>

                    <string>would mean His Love could harbor just a hint of hate, His gentleness turn sometimes to attack, and</string>
                    <string>His eternal patience sometimes fail. 6 All this do you believe, when you perceive a gap between</string>
                    <string>your brother and yourself. 7 How could you trust Him, then? 8 For He must be deceptive in His</string>
                    <string>Love. 9 Be wary, then; let Him not come too close, and leave a gap between you and His Love,</string>

                    <string>clause of separation was a point you both agreed to keep intact. 10 And violating this was thought to</string>

                    <string>And this but seems to be dividing off your separate minds. 3 It is the symbol of a promise made to</string>
                    <string>meet when you prefer, and separate till you and he elect to meet again. 4 And then your bodies</string>
                    <string>seem to get in touch, and thereby signify a meeting place to join. 5 But always is it possible for you</string>
                    <string>and him to go your separate ways. 6 Conditional upon the "right" to separate will you and he agree</string>
                    <string>to meet from time to time, and keep apart in intervals of separation, which do protect you from the</string>

                    <string>that lies not within itself. 3 And herein lies its power over you. 4 For now you think that it</string>
                    <string>determines when your brother and you meet, and limits your ability to make communion with your</string>
                    <string>brother's mind. 5 And now it tells you where to go and how to go there, what is feasible for you to</string>
                    <string>undertake, and what you cannot do. 6 It dictates what its health can tolerate, and what will tire it</string>
                    <string>and make it sick. 7 And its "inherent" weaknesses set up the limitations on what you would do, and</string>

                    <string>He must be savior from the dream he made, that he be free of it. 7 He must see someone else as not</string>

                    <string>T-29.IV.1. Do you believe that truth can be but some illusions? 2 They are dreams because they are</string>
                    <string>not true. 3 Their equal lack of truth becomes the basis for the miracle, which means that you have</string>
                    <string>understood that dreams are dreams; and that escape depends, not on the dream, but only on awaking.</string>
                    <string>4 Could it be some dreams are kept, and others wakened from? 5 The choice is not between which</string>
                    <string>dreams to keep, but only if you want to live in dreams or to awaken from them. 6 Thus it is the</string>
                    <string>miracle does not select some dreams to leave untouched by its beneficence. 7 You cannot dream</string>
                    <string>some dreams and wake from some, for you are either sleeping or awake. 8 And dreaming goes with</string>
                    <string>only one of these.</string>

                    <string>T-29.IV.2. The dreams you think you like would hold you back as much as those in which the fear</string>
                    <string>is seen. 2 For every dream is but a dream of fear, no matter what the form it seems to take. 3 The</string>
                    <string>fear is seen within, without, or both. 4 Or it can be disguised in pleasant form. 5 But never is it</string>
                    <string>absent from the dream, for fear is the material of dreams, from which they all are made. 6 Their</string>
                    <string>form can change, but they cannot be made of something else. 7 The miracle were treacherous indeed</string>
                    <string>if it allowed you still to be afraid because you did not recognize the fear. 8 You would not then be</string>
                    <string>willing to awake, for which the miracle prepares the way.</string>

                    <string>T-29.IV.3. In simplest form, it can be said attack is a response to function unfulfilled as you</string>
                    <string>perceive the function. 2 It can be in you or someone else, but where it is perceived it will be there it</string>
                    <string>is attacked. 3 Depression or assault must be the theme of every dream, for they are made of fear. 4</string>
                    <string>The thin disguise of pleasure and of joy in which they may be wrapped but slightly veils the heavy</string>
                    <string>lump of fear that is their core. 5 And it is this the miracle perceives, and not the wrappings in which</string>
                    <string>it is bound.</string>

                    <string>T-29.IV.4. When you are angry, is it not because someone has failed to fill the function you allotted</string>
                    <string>him? 2 And does not this become the "reason" your attack is justified? 3 The dreams you think you</string>
                    <string>like are those in which the functions you have given have been filled; the needs which you ascribe</string>
                    <string>to you are met. 4 It does not matter if they be fulfilled or merely wanted. 5 It is the idea that they</string>
                    <string>exist from which the fears arise. 6 Dreams are not wanted more or less. 7 They are desired or not. 8</string>
                    <string>And each one represents some function that you have assigned; some goal which an event, or body,</string>
                    <string>or a thing should represent, and should achieve for you. 9 If it succeeds you think you like the</string>
                    <string>dream. 10 If it should fail you think the dream is sad. 11 But whether it succeeds or fails is not its</string>
                    <string>core, but just the flimsy covering.</string>

                    <string>T-29.IV.5. How happy would your dreams become if you were not the one who gave the "proper"</string>
                    <string>role to every figure which the dream contains. 2 No one can fail but your idea of him, and there is</string>
                    <string>no betrayal but of this. 3 The core of dreams the Holy Spirit gives is never one of fear. 4 The</string>
                    <string>coverings may not appear to change, but what they mean has changed because they cover something</string>
                    <string>else. 5 Perceptions are determined by their purpose, in that they seem to be what they are for. 6 A</string>
                    <string>shadow figure who attacks becomes a brother giving you a chance to help, if this becomes the</string>
                    <string>function of the dream. 7 And dreams of sadness thus are turned to joy.</string>

                    <string>T-29.IV.6. What is your brother for? 2 You do not know, because your function is obscure to you. 3</string>
                    <string>Do not ascribe a role to him that you imagine would bring happiness to you. 4 And do not try to hurt</string>
                    <string>him when he fails to take the part that you assigned to him, in what you dream your life was meant</string>
                    <string>to be. 5 He asks for help in every dream he has, and you have help to give him if you see the</string>
                    <string>function of the dream as He perceives its function, Who can utilize all dreams as means to serve the</string>
                    <string>function given Him. 6 Because He loves the dreamer, not the dream, each dream becomes an</string>
                    <string>offering of love. 7 For at its center is His Love for you, which lights whatever form it takes with</string>
                    <string>love.</string>

                    <string>T-29.V.1. There is a place in you where this whole world has been forgotten; where no memory of</string>
                    <string>sin and of illusion lingers still. 2 There is a place in you which time has left, and echoes of eternity</string>
                    <string>are heard. 3 There is a resting place so still no sound except a hymn to Heaven rises up to gladden</string>
                    <string>God the Father and the Son. 4 Where Both abide are They remembered, Both. 5 And where They</string>
                    <string>are is Heaven and is peace.</string>

                    <string>T-29.V.2. Think not that you can change Their dwelling place. 2 For your Identity abides in Them,</string>
                    <string>and where They are, forever must you be. 3 The changelessness of Heaven is in you, so deep within</string>
                    <string>that nothing in this world but passes by, unnoticed and unseen. 4 The still infinity of endless peace</string>
                    <string>surrounds you gently in its soft embrace, so strong and quiet, tranquil in the might of its Creator,</string>
                    <string>nothing can intrude upon the sacred Son of God within.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-29.V.3. Here is the role the Holy Spirit gives to you who wait upon the Son of God, and would</string>
                    <string>behold him waken and be glad. 2 He is a part of you and you of him, because he is his Father's Son,</string>
                    <string>and not for any purpose you may see in him. 3 Nothing is asked of you but to accept the changeless</string>
                    <string>and eternal that abide in him, for your Identity is there. 4 The peace in you can but be found in him.</string>
                    <string>5 And every thought of love you offer him but brings you nearer to your wakening to peace eternal</string>
                    <string>and to endless joy.</string>

                    <string>T-29.V.4. This sacred Son of God is like yourself; the mirror of his Father's Love for you, the soft</string>
                    <string>reminder of his Father's Love by which he was created and which still abides in him as it abides in</string>
                    <string>you. 2 Be very still and hear God's Voice in him, and let It tell you what his function is. 3 He was</string>
                    <string>created that you might be whole, for only the complete can be a part of God's completion, which</string>
                    <string>created you.</string>

                  <ACIMParagraph>
                    <string>T-29.V.5. There is no gift the Father asks of you but that you see in all creation but the shining</string>
                    <string>glory of His gift to you. 2 Behold His Son, His perfect gift, in whom his Father shines forever, and</string>
                    <string>to whom is all creation given as his own. 3 Because he has it is it given you, and where it lies in him</string>
                    <string>behold your peace. 4 The quiet that surrounds you dwells in him, and from this quiet come the</string>
                    <string>happy dreams in which your hands are joined in innocence. 5 These are not hands that grasp in</string>
                    <string>dreams of pain. 6 They hold no sword, for they have left their hold on every vain illusion of the</string>
                    <string>world. 7 And being empty they receive, instead, a brother's hand in which completion lies.</string>

                    <string>T-29.V.6. If you but knew the glorious goal that lies beyond forgiveness, you would not keep hold</string>
                    <string>on any thought, however light the touch of evil on it may appear to be. 2 For you would understand</string>
                    <string>how great the cost of holding anything God did not give in minds that can direct the hand to bless,</string>
                    <string>and lead God's Son unto his Father's house. 3 Would you not want to be a friend to him, created by</string>
                    <string>his Father as His home? 4 If God esteems him worthy of Himself, would you attack him with the</string>
                    <string>hands of hate? 5 Who would lay bloody hands on Heaven itself, and hope to find its peace? 6 Your</string>
                    <string>brother thinks he holds the hand of death. 7 Believe him not. 8 But learn, instead, how blessed are</string>
                    <string>you who can release him, just by offering him yours.</string>

                    <string>T-29.V.7. A dream is given you in which he is your savior, not your enemy in hate. 2 A dream is</string>
                    <string>given you in which you have forgiven him for all his dreams of death; a dream of hope you share</string>
                    <string>with him, instead of dreaming evil separate dreams of hate. 3 Why does it seem so hard to share this</string>
                    <string>dream? 4 Because unless the Holy Spirit gives the dream its function, it was made for hate, and will</string>
                    <string>continue in death's services. 5 Each form it takes in some way calls for death. 6 And those who</string>
                    <string>serve the lord of death have come to worship in a separated world, each with his tiny spear and</string>
                    <string>rusted sword, to keep his ancient promises to die.</string>

                    <string>T-29.V.8. Such is the core of fear in every dream that has been kept apart from use by Him Who</string>
                    <string>sees a different function for a dream. 2 When dreams are shared they lose the function of attack and</string>
                    <string>separation, even though it was for this that every dream was made. 3 Yet nothing in the world of</string>
                    <string>dreams remains without the hope of change and betterment, for here is not where changelessness is</string>
                    <string>found. 4 Let us be glad indeed that this is so, and seek not the eternal in this world. 5 Forgiving</string>
                    <string>dreams are means to step aside from dreaming of a world outside yourself. 6 And leading finally</string>
                    <string>beyond all dreams, unto the peace of everlasting life.</string>

                    <string>of endless strife and misery and pain? 3 These questions are the same, in different form. 4</string>
                    <string>Forgiveness is your peace, for herein lies the end of separation and the dream of danger and</string>
                    <string>destruction, sin and death; of madness and of murder, grief and loss. 5 This is the "sacrifice"</string>
                    <string>salvation asks, and gladly offers peace instead of this.</string>

                    <string>The Son of Life cannot be killed. 4 He is immortal as his Father. 5 What he is cannot be changed. 6</string>
                    <string>He is the only thing in all the universe that must be one. 7 What seems eternal all will have an end.</string>
                    <string>8 The stars will disappear, and night and day will be no more. 9 All things that come and go, the</string>

                    <string>return. 10 Where time has set an end is not where the eternal is. 11 God's Son can never change by</string>
                    <string>what men made of him. 12 He will be as he was and as he is, for time appointed not his destiny, nor</string>
                    <string>set the hour of his birth and death. 13 Forgiveness will not change him. 14 Yet time waits upon</string>

                    <string>not take this purpose as its own. 3 Change is the only thing that can be made a blessing here, where</string>
                    <string>purpose is not fixed, however changeless it appears to be. 4 Think not that you can set a goal unlike</string>
                    <string>God's purpose for you, and establish it as changeless and eternal. 5 You can give yourself a purpose</string>
                    <string>that you do not have. 6 But you can not remove the power to change your mind, and see another</string>

                    <string>only Heaven would not pass away. 2 You were not born to die. 3 You cannot change, because your</string>
                    <string>function has been fixed by God. 4 All other goals are set in time and change that time might be</string>
                    <string>preserved, excepting one. 5 Forgiveness does not aim at keeping time, but at its ending, when it has</string>
                    <string>no use. 6 Its purpose ended, it is gone. 7 And where it once held seeming sway is now restored the</string>
                    <string>function God established for His Son in full awareness. 8 Time can set no end to its fulfillment nor</string>
                    <string>its changelessness. 9 There is no death because the living share the function their Creator gave to</string>
                    <string>them. 10 Life's function cannot be to die. 11 It must be life's extension, that it be as one forever and</string>

                    <string>give you more than God bestowed upon your brother and on you, as one with Him? 7 God gave you</string>
                    <string>all there is. 8 And to be sure you could not lose it, did He also give the same to every living thing as</string>
                    <string>well. 9 And thus is every living thing a part of you, as of Himself. 10 No idol can establish you as</string>

                    <string>worship to what has no life, and seek for power in the powerless. 3 What happened to the holy Son</string>
                    <string>of God that this could be his wish; to let himself fall lower than the stones upon the ground, and</string>
                    <string>look to idols that they raise him up? 4 Hear, then, your story in the dream you made, and ask</string>

                    <string>that dream was Heaven changed to hell, and God made enemy unto His Son. 3 How can God's Son</string>
                    <string>awaken from the dream? 4 It is a dream of judgment. 5 So must he judge not, and he will waken. 6</string>
                    <string>For the dream will seem to last while he is part of it. 7 Judge not, for he who judges will have need</string>
                    <string>of idols, which will hold the judgment off from resting on himself. 8 Nor can he know the Self he</string>
                    <string>has condemned. 9 Judge not, because you make yourself a part of evil dreams, where idols are your</string>
                    <string>"true" identity, and your salvation from the judgment laid in terror and in guilt upon yourself.</string>

                    <string>terrible, for who could wish for one unless he were in terror and despair? 4 And this the idol</string>
                    <string>represents, and so its worship is the worship of despair and terror, and the dream from which they</string>
                    <string>come. 5 Judgment is an injustice to God's Son, and it is justice that who judges him will not escape</string>
                    <string>the penalty he laid upon himself within the dream he made. 6 God knows of justice, not of penalty.</string>
                    <string>7 But in the dream of judgment you attack and are condemned; and wish to be the slave of idols,</string>

                    <string>instead. 6 And their reality becomes his own, because they seem to save him from his thoughts. 7</string>
                    <string>Yet do they keep his thoughts alive and real, but seen outside himself, where they can turn against</string>

                    <string>he thinks the thoughts are real. 9 And so he makes of anything a toy, to make his world remain</string>

                    <string>judgment is a children's game, in which the child becomes the father, powerful, but with the little</string>

                    <string>happen, and he is afraid of all the chaos in a world he thinks is governed by the laws he made. 8</string>

                    <string>something he is not, for childish things have all been put away. 6 And what was once a dream of</string>
                    <string>judgment now has changed into a dream where all is joy, because that is the purpose that it has. 7</string>
                    <string>Only forgiving dreams can enter here, for time is almost over. 8 And the forms that enter in the</string>

                    <string>the Son of God. 6 And when he hears this song again, he knows he never heard it not. 7 And where</string>

                    <string>of doom. 3 Your self-betrayal must result in fear, for fear is judgment, leading surely to the frantic</string>

                    <string>to change your mind with this: 2 At least I can decide I do not like what I feel now. 3 This much is</string>
                    <string>obvious, and paves the way for the next easy step.</string>

                    <string>continue with: 2 And so I hope I have been wrong. 3 This works against the sense of opposition,</string>
                    <string>and reminds you that help is not being thrust upon you but is something that you want and that you</string>
                    <string>need, because you do not like the way you feel. 4 This tiny opening will be enough to let you go</string>
                    <string>ahead with just a few more steps you need to let yourself be helped.</string>

                    <string>if what you have decided is not so. 2 Until this point is reached, you will believe your happiness</string>
                    <string>depends on being right. 3 But this much reason have you now attained; you would be better off if</string>

                    <string>merely hope to get a thing you want. 3 And you can say in perfect honesty: 4 I want another way to</string>
                    <string>look at this. 5 Now you have changed your mind about the day, and have remembered what you</string>
                    <string>really want. 6 Its purpose has no longer been obscured by the insane belief you want it for the goal</string>
                    <string>of being right when you are wrong. 7 Thus is the readiness for asking brought to your awareness, for</string>
                    <string>you cannot be in conflict when you ask for what you want, and see that it is this for which you ask.</string>

                    <string>statement of an open mind, not certain yet, but willing to be shown: 3 Perhaps there is another way</string>
                    <string>to look at this. 4 What can I lose by asking? 5 Thus you now can ask a question that makes sense,</string>
                    <string>and so the answer will make sense as well. 6 Nor will you fight against it, for you see that it is you</string>

                    <string>When this has been achieved, the sorry dream of judgment has forever been undone. 4 But</string>
                    <string>meanwhile, you have need for practicing the rules for its undoing. 5 Let us, then, consider once</string>

                    <string>T-30.I.14. We said you can begin a happy day with the determination not to make decisions by</string>
                    <string>yourself. 2 This seems to be a real decision in itself. 3 And yet, you cannot make decisions by</string>
                    <string>yourself. 4 The only question really is with what you choose to make them. 5 That is really all. 6</string>
                    <string>The first rule, then, is not coercion, but a simple statement of a simple fact. 7 You will not make</string>
                    <string>decisions by yourself whatever you decide. 8 For they are made with idols or with God. 9 And you</string>
                    <string>ask help of anti-Christ or Christ, and which you choose will join with you and tell you what to do.</string>

                    <string>friend whose counsel you have sought perceives your happiness. 3 You always ask advice before</string>
                    <string>you can decide on anything. 4 Let this be understood, and you can see there cannot be coercion</string>
                    <string>here, nor grounds for opposition that you may be free. 5 There is no freedom from what must occur.</string>

                    <string>want before it can occur. 3 It is but this agreement that permits all things to happen. 4 Nothing can</string>
                    <string>be caused without some form of union, be it with a dream of judgment or the Voice for God. 5</string>
                    <string>Decisions cause results because they are not made in isolation. 6 They are made by you and your</string>
                    <string>adviser, for yourself and for the world as well. 7 The day you want you offer to the world, for it will</string>
                    <string>be what you have asked for, and will reinforce the rule of your adviser in the world. 8 Whose</string>

                    <string>it all effects that it will ever have. 4 It needs but two. 5 These two are joined before there can be a</string>
                    <string>decision. 6 Let this be the one reminder that you keep in mind, and you will have the day you want,</string>
                    <string>and give it to the world by having it yourself. 7 Your judgment has been lifted from the world by</string>
                    <string>your decision for a happy day. 8 And as you have received, so must you give.</string>

                    <string>He joins with you. 7 He did not set His Kingdom up alone. 8 And Heaven itself but represents your</string>

                    <string>as you would have it be. 10 And not one Thought that God has ever had but waited for your</string>
                    <string>blessing to be born. 11 God is no enemy to you. 12 He asks no more than that He hear you call Him</string>

                    <string>ever should be called by freedom's name. 4 Unless you do your will you are not free. 5 And would</string>
                    <string>God leave His Son without what he has chosen for himself? 6 God but ensured that you would never</string>
                    <string>lose your will when He gave you His perfect Answer. 7 Hear It now, that you may be reminded of</string>
                    <string>His Love and learn your will. 8 God would not have His Son made prisoner to what he does not</string>
                    <string>want. 9 He joins with you in willing you be free. 10 And to oppose Him is to make a choice against</string>

                    <string>was hatred born into the world, and thus the rule of fear established there. 3 Now hear God speak to</string>
                    <string>you, through Him Who is His Voice and yours as well, reminding you that it is not your will to hate</string>
                    <string>and be a prisoner to fear, a slave to death, a little creature with a little life. 4 Your will is boundless;</string>
                    <string>it is not your will that it be bound. 5 What lies in you has joined with God Himself in all creation's</string>

                    <string>you be prisoner, then God Himself could not be free. 3 For what is done to him whom God so loves</string>
                    <string>is done to God Himself. 4 Think not He wills to bind you, Who has made you co-creator of the</string>

                    <string>thus reducing it to a specific form. 11 Yet this could never be your will, because what shares in all</string>

                    <string>achieve completion in a form you like. 5 This is the purpose of an idol; that you will not look</string>
                    <string>beyond it, to the source of the belief that you are incomplete. 6 Only if you had sinned could this be</string>
                    <string>so. 7 For sin is the idea you are alone and separated off from what is whole. 8 And thus it would be</string>

                    <string>is no ending, nor a time in which His Thoughts were absent or could suffer change. 5 Thoughts are</string>
                    <string>not born and cannot die. 6 They share the attributes of their creator, nor have they a separate life</string>
                    <string>apart from his. 7 The thoughts you think are in your mind, as you are in the Mind which thought of</string>
                    <string>you. 8 And so there are no separate parts in what exists within God's Mind. 9 It is forever One,</string>

                    <string>it is there. 6 Yet still and white and lovely will it shine through all eternity. 7 There was no time it</string>

                    <string>earth or not. 3 The sky embraces it and softly holds it in its perfect place, which is as far from earth</string>

                    <string>silent woolly bear begins to squeak as he takes hold of it. 3 The rules he made for boxes and for</string>
                    <string>bears have failed him, and have broken his "control" of what surrounds him. 4 And he is afraid,</string>
                    <string>because he thought the rules protected him. 5 Now must he learn the boxes and the bears did not</string>
                    <string>deceive him, broke no rules, nor mean his world is made chaotic and unsafe. 6 He was mistaken. 7</string>

                    <string>popping heads and squeaking toys, as does the child who learns they are no threat to him. 7 Yet</string>
                    <string>while he likes to play with them, he still perceives them as obeying rules he made for his</string>
                    <string>enjoyment. 8 So there still are rules that they can seem to break and frighten him. 9 Yet is he at the</string>

                    <string>again. 6 They are but toys, my child, so do not grieve for them. 7 Their dancing never brought you</string>
                    <string>joy. 8 But neither were they things to frighten you, nor make you safe if they obeyed your rules. 9</string>
                    <string>They must be neither cherished nor attacked, but merely looked upon as children's toys without a</string>

                    <string>5 Attack has power to make illusions real. 6 Yet what it makes is nothing. 7 Who could be made</string>
                    <string>fearful by a power that can have no real effects at all? 8 What could it be but an illusion, making</string>

                    <string>dance to vain desires. 10 Give them not your worship, for they are not there. 11 Yet this is equally</string>
                    <string>forgotten in attack. 12 God's Son needs no defense against his dreams. 13 His idols do not threaten</string>

                    <string>changes have been quickly brought about, when you decide one very simple thing; you do not want</string>
                    <string>whatever you believe an idol gives. 5 For thus the Son of God declares that he is free of idols. 6</string>

                    <string>upon the unreal as reality. 4 You are but asked to let your will be done, and seek no longer for the</string>
                    <string>things you do not want. 5 And you are asked to let yourself be free of all the dreams of what you</string>

                    <string>fit into the dream of fear. 5 Instead, there is a wish to understand all things created as they really</string>

                    <string>barely stay and wait a little longer, with his feet still touching earth. 6 Yet is he glad to wait till</string>

                    <string>justified, your pardon will become the answer to attack that has been made. 10 And thus is pardon</string>

                    <string>on error, and thus calls for help. 8 Forgiveness is the only sane response. 9 It keeps your rights from</string>

                    <string>would "forgive." 5 Unjustified forgiveness is attack. 6 And this is all the world can ever give. 7 It</string>
                    <string>pardons "sinners" sometimes, but remains aware that they have sinned. 8 And so they do not merit</string>

                    <string>forgiveness is your right as much as his. 8 Nor will you think that God intends for you a fearful</string>
                    <string>judgment that your brother does not merit. 9 For it is the truth that you can merit neither more nor</string>

                    <string>limited. 6 And you have set a goal of partial pardon and a limited escape from guilt for you. 7 What</string>

                    <string>Salvation rests on faith there cannot be some forms of guilt that you cannot forgive. 8 And so there</string>

                    <string>he is not bound by loss or suffering in any form, because it can so easily be changed. 7 This</string>

                    <string>and give to them reality instead. 5 And Heaven gives no answer to the prayer, nor can a miracle be</string>
                    <string>given you to heal appearances you do not like. 6 You have established limits. 7 What you ask is</string>

                    <string>death. 8 But if he calls for death or calls for life, for hate or for forgiveness and for help, is not the</string>
                    <string>same in outcome. 9 Hear the one, and you are separate from him and are lost. 10 But hear the other,</string>
                    <string>and you join with him and in your answer is salvation found. 11 The voice you hear in him is but</string>
                    <string>your own. 12 What does he ask you for? 13 And listen well! 14 For he is asking what will come to</string>

                    <string>the mind. 9 The body must act on its own, and motivate itself. 10 If you are sin you lock the mind</string>
                    <string>within the body, and you give its purpose to its prison house, which acts instead of it. 11 A jailer</string>

                    <string>because that mind is sick within itself. 8 Learning is all that causes change. 9 And so the body,</string>
                    <string>where no learning can occur, could never change unless the mind preferred the body change in its</string>
                    <string>appearances, to suit the purpose given by the mind. 10 For mind can learn, and there is all change</string>

                    <string>that its purpose is to keep. 2 Why should this be? 3 Because it is a place where choice among</string>
                    <string>illusions seems to be the only choice. 4 And you are in control of outcomes of your choosing. 5</string>
                    <string>Thus you think, within the narrow band from birth to death, a little time is given you to use for you</string>
                    <string>alone; a time when everyone conflicts with you, but you can choose which road will lead you out of</string>
                    <string>conflict, and away from difficulties that concern you not. 6 Yet they are your concern. 7 How, then,</string>
                    <string>can you escape from them by leaving them behind? 8 What must go with you, you will take with</string>

                    <string>disappointment, nothingness and death. 4 There is no choice in its alternatives. 5 Seek not escape</string>
                    <string>from problems here. 6 The world was made that problems could not be escaped. 7 Be not deceived</string>
                    <string>by all the different names its roads are given. 8 They have but one end. 9 And each is but the means</string>
                    <string>to gain that end, for it is here that all its roads will lead, however differently they seem to start;</string>
                    <string>however differently they seem to go. 10 Their end is certain, for there is no choice among them. 11</string>
                    <string>All of them will lead to death. 12 On some you travel gaily for a while, before the bleakness enters.</string>
                    <string>13 And on some the thorns are felt at once. 14 The choice is not what will the ending be, but when it</string>

                    <string>before you really learn they are but one. 3 The roads this world can offer seem to be quite large in</string>
                    <string>number, but the time must come when everyone begins to see how like they are to one another. 4</string>
                    <string>Men have died on seeing this, because they saw no way except the pathways offered by the world. 5</string>
                    <string>And learning they led nowhere, lost their hope. 6 And yet this was the time they could have learned</string>
                    <string>their greatest lesson. 7 All must reach this point, and go beyond it. 8 It is true indeed there is no</string>
                    <string>choice at all within the world. 9 But this is not the lesson in itself. 10 The lesson has a purpose, and</string>

                    <string>learned the way the lesson starts, but do not yet perceive what it is for? 2 Its purpose is the answer</string>

                    <string>now, without despair, there is no hope of answer in the world. 4 But do not judge the lesson that is</string>
                    <string>but begun with this. 5 Seek not another signpost in the world that seems to point to still another</string>
                    <string>road. 6 No longer look for hope where there is none. 7 Make fast your learning now, and understand</string>
                    <string>you but waste time unless you go beyond what you have learned to what is yet to learn. 8 For from</string>
                    <string>this lowest point will learning lead to heights of happiness, in which you see the purpose of the</string>

                    <string>The great release of power must begin with learning where it really has a use. 5 And what decision</string>

                    <string>defeat your purpose here. 3 You did not come to learn to find a road the world does not contain. 4</string>
                    <string>The search for different pathways in the world is but the search for different forms of truth. 5 And</string>

                    <string>let me repeat that to achieve a goal you must proceed in its direction, not away from it. 4 And every</string>
                    <string>road that leads the other way will not advance the purpose to be found. 5 If this be difficult to</string>

                    <string>what he does, for your accusing finger points to him, unwavering and deadly in its aim. 5 It points</string>
                    <string>to you as well, but this is kept still deeper in the mists below the face of innocence. 6 And in these</string>

                    <string>is that you are what your brother made of you. 3 For even though you do not yet perceive that this is</string>
                    <string>what you think, you surely learned by now that you behave as if it were. 4 Does he react for you? 5</string>
                    <string>And does he know exactly what would happen? 6 Can he see your future and ordain, before it</string>
                    <string>comes, what you should do in every circumstance? 7 He must have made the world as well as you</string>

                    <string>foolishness, and merely think of this; there are two parts to what you think yourself to be. 7 If one</string>
                    <string>were generated by your brother, who was there to make the other? 8 And from whom must</string>
                    <string>something be kept hidden? 9 If the world be evil, there is still no need to hide what you are made</string>
                    <string>of. 10 Who is there to see? 11 And what but is attacked could need defense?</string>

                    <string>underpinnings were removed? 3 Your concept of the world depends upon this concept of the self. 4</string>
                    <string>And both would go, if either one were ever raised to doubt. 5 The Holy Spirit does not seek to</string>

                    <string>passive, and at least makes way for active choice, and some acknowledgment that interaction must</string>
                    <string>have entered in. 4 There is some understanding that you chose for both of you, and what he</string>
                    <string>represents has meaning that was given it by you. 5 It also shows some glimmering of sight into</string>

                    <string>did the choosing first? 7 If you are what you chose your brother be, alternatives were there to</string>
                    <string>choose among, and someone must have first decided on the one to choose, and let the other go.</string>

                    <string>which gave rise to them. 4 Nor can this be explained by either view. 5 The main advantage of the</string>
                    <string>shifting to the second from the first is that you somehow entered in the choice by your decision. 6</string>
                    <string>But this gain is paid in almost equal loss, for now you stand accused of guilt for what your brother</string>
                    <string>is. 7 And you must share his guilt, because you chose it for him in the image of your own. 8 While</string>

                    <string>nothing more than the escape from concepts. 4 It does not concern itself with content of the mind,</string>
                    <string>but with the simple statement that it thinks. 5 And what can think has choice, and can be shown that</string>
                    <string>different thoughts have different consequence. 6 So it can learn that everything it thinks reflects the</string>
                    <string>deep confusion that it feels about how it was made and what it is. 7 And vaguely does the concept</string>

                    <string>your learning has been guided by the world, and you behold it as you see yourself. 7 The concept of</string>
                    <string>the self embraces all you look upon, and nothing is outside of this perception. 8 If you can be hurt</string>
                    <string>by anything, you see a picture of your secret wishes. 9 Nothing more than this. 10 And in your</string>

                    <string>contrasts, not in truth, which has no opposite and cannot change. 5 In this world's concepts are the</string>
                    <string>guilty "bad"; the "good" are innocent. 6 And no one here but holds a concept of himself in which he</string>
                    <string>counts the "good" to pardon him the "bad." 7 Nor does he trust the "good" in anyone, believing that</string>
                    <string>the "bad" must lurk behind. 8 This concept emphasizes treachery, and trust becomes impossible. 9</string>

                    <string>yourself. 5 But should one brother dawn upon your sight as wholly worthy of forgiveness, then your</string>
                    <string>concept of yourself is wholly changed. 6 Your "evil" thoughts have been forgiven with his, because</string>
                    <string>you let them all affect you not. 7 No longer do you choose that you should be the sign of evil and of</string>

                    <string>of you, and thus of him as well. 3 By focusing upon the good in him, the body grows decreasingly</string>
                    <string>persistent in your sight, and will at length be seen as little more than just a shadow circling round</string>
                    <string>the good. 4 And this will be your concept of yourself, when you have reached the world beyond the</string>
                    <string>sight your eyes alone can offer you to see. 5 For you will not interpret what you see without the Aid</string>

                    <string>love this concept of yourself, because it was not made for you alone. 4 Born as a gift for someone</string>
                    <string>not perceived to be yourself, it has been given you. 5 For your forgiveness, offered unto him, has</string>

                    <string>because they do not cloud your view of him. 3 And all this shift requires is that you be willing that</string>
                    <string>this happy change occur. 4 No more than this is asked. 5 On its behalf, remember what the concept</string>
                    <string>of yourself that now you hold has brought you in its wake, and welcome the glad contrast offered</string>
                    <string>you. 6 Hold out your hand, that you may have the gift of kind forgiveness which you offer one</string>
                    <string>whose need for it is just the same as yours. 7 And let the cruel concept of yourself be changed to</string>

                    <string>he looks upon one brother as he looks upon himself, and sees the mirror of himself in him. 5 Thus is</string>
                    <string>the concept of himself laid by, for nothing stands between his sight and what he looks upon, to</string>

                    <string>he looks on everyone as he beholds this one. 7 For there is light where darkness was before, and</string>

                    <string>so they call it forth in everyone they look upon, that he may be what they expect of him. 5 This is</string>
                    <string>the savior's vision; that he see his innocence in all he looks upon, and see his own salvation</string>
                    <string>everywhere. 6 He holds no concept of himself between his calm and open eyes and what he sees. 7</string>

                    <string>because it does not know. 5 And recognizing this, it merely asks, "What is the meaning of what I</string>
                    <string>behold?" 6 Then is the answer given. 7 And the door held open for the face of Christ to shine upon</string>
                    <string>the one who asks, in innocence, to see beyond the veil of old ideas and ancient concepts held so</string>

                    <string>T-31.VIII.1. Temptation has one lesson it would teach, in all its forms, wherever it occurs. 2 It</string>
                    <string>would persuade the holy Son of God he is a body, born in what must die, unable to escape its</string>
                    <string>frailty, and bound by what it orders him to feel. 3 It sets the limits on what he can do; its power is</string>
                    <string>the only strength he has; his grasp cannot exceed its tiny reach. 4 Would you be this, if Christ</string>
                    <string>appeared to you in all His glory, asking you but this: 5 Choose once again if you would take your</string>
                    <string>place among the saviors of the world, or would remain in hell, and hold your brothers there. 6 For</string>
                    <string>He has come, and He is asking this.</string>

                    <string>T-31.VIII.2. How do you make the choice? 2 How easily is this explained! 3 You always choose</string>
                    <string>between your weakness and the strength of Christ in you. 4 And what you choose is what you think</string>
                    <string>is real. 5 Simply by never using weakness to direct your actions, you have given it no power. 6 And</string>
                    <string>the light of Christ in you is given charge of everything you do. 7 For you have brought your</string>
                    <string>weakness unto Him, and He has given you His strength instead.</string>

                    <string>T-31.VIII.3. Trials are but lessons that you failed to learn presented once again, so where you made</string>
                    <string>a faulty choice before you now can make a better one, and thus escape all pain that what you chose</string>
                    <string>before has brought to you. 2 In every difficulty, all distress, and each perplexity Christ calls to you</string>
                    <string>and gently says, "My brother, choose again." 3 He would not leave one source of pain unhealed, nor</string>
                    <string>any image left to veil the truth. 4 He would remove all misery from you whom God created altar</string>
                    <string>unto joy. 5 He would not leave you comfortless, alone in dreams of hell, but would release your</string>
                    <string>mind from everything that hides His face from you. 6 His Holiness is yours because He is the only</string>
                    <string>power that is real in you. 7 His strength is yours because He is the Self that God created as His only</string>
                    <string>Son.</string>

                    <string>T-31.VIII.4. The images you make cannot prevail against what God Himself would have you be. 2</string>
                    <string>Be never fearful of temptation, then, but see it as it is; another chance to choose again, and let</string>
                    <string>Christ's strength prevail in every circumstance and every place you raised an image of yourself</string>
                    <string>before. 3 For what appears to hide the face of Christ is powerless before His majesty, and disappears</string>
                    <string>before His holy sight. 4 The saviors of the world, who see like Him, are merely those who choose</string>
                    <string>His strength instead of their own weakness, seen apart from Him. 5 They will redeem the world, for</string>
                    <string>they are joined in all the power of the Will of God. 6 And what they will is only what He wills.</string>

                    <string>T-31.VIII.5. Learn, then, the happy habit of response to all temptation to perceive yourself as weak</string>
                    <string>and miserable with these words: 2 I am as God created me. 3 His Son can suffer nothing. 4 And I</string>
                    <string>am His Son. 5 Thus is Christ's strength invited to prevail, replacing all your weakness with the</string>
                    <string>strength that comes from God and that can never fail. 6 And thus are miracles as natural as fear and</string>
                    <string>agony appeared to be before the choice for holiness was made. 7 For in that choice are false</string>
                    <string>distinctions gone, illusory alternatives laid by, and nothing left to interfere with truth.</string>

                    <string>T-31.VIII.6. You are as God created you, and so is every living thing you look upon, regardless of</string>
                    <string>the images you see. 2 What you behold as sickness and as pain, as weakness and as suffering and</string>
                    <string>loss, is but temptation to perceive yourself defenseless and in hell. 3 Yield not to this, and you will</string>
                    <string>see all pain, in every form, wherever it occurs, but disappear as mists before the sun. 4 A miracle</string>
                    <string>has come to heal God's Son, and close the door upon his dreams of weakness, opening the way to</string>
                    <string>his salvation and release. 5 Choose once again what you would have him be, remembering that</string>
                    <string>every choice you make establishes your own identity as you will see it and believe it is.</string>

                    <string>constant fear. 2 For it is given you to join with him, and through the Christ in you unveil his eyes,</string>

                    <string>for nothing but your own release. 3 There is no place for hell within a world whose loveliness can</string>
                    <string>yet be so intense and so inclusive it is but a step from there to Heaven. 4 To your tired eyes I bring</string>
                    <string>a vision of a different world, so new and clean and fresh you will forget the pain and sorrow that</string>
                    <string>you saw before. 5 Yet this a vision is which you must share with everyone you see, for otherwise</string>
                    <string>you will behold it not. 6 To give this gift is how to make it yours. 7 And God ordained, in loving</string>
                    <string>kindness, that it be for you.</string>

                    <string>another situation where God's gift can once again be recognized as ours! 2 And thus will all the</string>
                    <string>vestiges of hell, the secret sins and hidden hates be gone. 3 And all the loveliness which they</string>
                    <string>concealed appear like lawns of Heaven to our sight, to lift us high above the thorny roads we</string>
                    <string>travelled on before the Christ appeared. 4 Hear me, my brothers, hear and join with me. 5 God has</string>
                    <string>ordained I cannot call in vain, and in His certainty I rest content. 6 For you will hear, and you will</string>

                    <string>behalf. 5 And as I would but do Your holy Will, so will they choose. 6 And I give thanks for them. 7</string>
                    <string>Salvation's song will echo through the world with every choice they make. 8 For we are one in</string>

                    <string>what is but Your Will? 4 I give You thanks for what my brothers are. 5 And as each one elects to</string>
                    <string>join with me, the song of thanks from earth to Heaven grows from tiny scattered threads of melody</string>
                    <string>to one inclusive chorus from a world redeemed from hell, and giving thanks to You.</string>

            <string>that is beyond what can be taught. 7 It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness</string>
            <string>of love's presence, which is your natural inheritance. 8 The opposite of love is fear, but what is</string>

            <string>This is followed by a description of the specific procedures by which the idea for the day is to be</string>
            <string>applied.</string>

            <string>W-in.4. The purpose of the workbook is to train your mind in a systematic way to a different</string>
            <string>perception of everyone and everything in the world. 2 The exercises are planned to help you</string>
            <string>generalize the lessons, so that you will understand that each of them is equally applicable to</string>
            <string>everyone and everything you see.</string>

            <string>W-in.5. Transfer of training in true perception does not proceed as does transfer of the training of</string>
            <string>the world. 2 If true perception has been achieved in connection with any person, situation or event,</string>
            <string>total transfer to everyone and everything is certain. 3 On the other hand, one exception held apart</string>
            <string>from true perception makes its accomplishments anywhere impossible.</string>

        <BKParagraph>
          <ACIMParagraph>
            <string>W-in.6. The only general rules to be observed throughout, then, are: First, that the exercises be</string>
            <string>practiced with great specificity, as will be indicated. 2 This will help you to generalize the ideas</string>
            <string>involved to every situation in which you find yourself, and to everyone and everything in it. 3</string>
            <string>Second, be sure that you do not decide for yourself that there are some people, situations or things to</string>
            <string>which the ideas are inapplicable. 4 This will interfere with transfer of training. 5 The very nature of</string>
            <string>true perception is that it has no limits. 6 It is the opposite of the way you see now.</string>
          </ACIMParagraph>
        </BKParagraph>
        <BKParagraph>
          <ACIMParagraph>
            <string>W-in.7. The overall aim of the exercises is to increase your ability to extend the ideas you will be</string>
            <string>practicing to include everything. 2 This will require no effort on your part. 3 The exercises</string>
            <string>themselves meet the conditions necessary for this kind of transfer.</string>
          </ACIMParagraph>
        </BKParagraph>
        <BKParagraph>
          <ACIMParagraph>
            <string>W-in.8. Some of the ideas the workbook presents you will find hard to believe, and others may</string>
            <string>seem to be quite startling. 2 This does not matter. 3 You are merely asked to apply the ideas as you</string>
            <string>are directed to do. 4 You are not asked to judge them at all. 5 You are asked only to use them. 6 It is</string>
            <string>their use that will give them meaning to you, and will show you that they are true.</string>
          </ACIMParagraph>
        </BKParagraph>
        <BKParagraph>
          <ACIMParagraph>
            <string>W-in.9. Remember only this; you need not believe the ideas, you need not accept them, and you</string>
            <string>need not even welcome them. 2 Some of them you may actively resist. 3 None of this will matter, or</string>
            <string>decrease their efficacy. 4 But do not allow yourself to make exceptions in applying the ideas the</string>
            <string>workbook contains, and whatever your reactions to the ideas may be, use them. 5 Nothing more than</string>
            <string>that is required.</string>
